But as a company that builds artificial intelligence to do just that, it\\'s our job to overcome this assumption. There\\'s no doubt that AI systems are capable of solving remarkably complicated problems. Why should language — perhaps the most impactful problem of all — be any different?\\n\\nSo here\\'s the challenge: making inherently ambiguous language more like the highly structured world of chess. And to develop that structure, two techniques have proven equally critical: natural language processing (NLP) and natural language understanding (NLU). NLP organizes language into the structured data that computers require to process, while NLU interprets that data to derive meaning.\\n\\nTo appreciate the strides computers have already made toward understanding language, let’s talk about one of the first major challenges put before them: chess. Chess is no less complex than language, and yet computers were capable of defeating even chess grandmasters decades ago. By considering a huge amount of situational data, chess-playing programs not only figure out their next move; they also anticipate the next three moves, five moves, and even ten moves down the line.\\n\\nIn this blog, we’ll cover:\\n\\nHow NLP gives structure to unstructured language\\n\\nHow NLU uses such structure to figure out a user\\'s intent\\n\\nWhy NLP and NLU must work in tandem to understand language\\n\\nNLP: structuring unstructured language\\n\\nTo learn why computers have struggled to understand language, it’s helpful to first figure out why they\\'re so competent at playing chess. Chess, needless to say, isn’t easy. There are more possible moves in a game than there are atoms in the universe.\\n\\nBut while playing chess isn’t inherently easier than processing language, chess does have extremely well-defined rules. There are certain moves each piece can make and only a certain amount of space on the board for them to move. Computers thrive at finding patterns when provided with this kind of rigid structure. Yet language is not so formulaic. It breaks rules all the time.\\n\\nFigure 1: At its most basic level, NLP involves treating each utterance as a unique string of words, with minimal interpretation. In this example — a chatbot only knows the preprogrammed phrase “I need Zoom,” and it is unable to respond to slightly altered phrasing.\\n\\nThe easiest way to structure unstructured language is to treat each unique utterance as its own data point. The equivalent in chess would be making moves completely dependent on the opponent’s last move: advancing a pawn simply because the other person moved their rook. Obviously, this is a losing strategy — both in chess and in language learning.\\n\\nFigure 2: The goal of NLP is to provide structure to unstructured, ambiguous language.\\n\\nIn Figure 2, we see a more sophisticated manifestation of NLP, which gives language the structure needed to process different phrasings of what is functionally the same request. With a greater level of intelligence, NLP helps computers pick apart individual components of language and use them as variables to extract only relevant features from user utterances.\\n\\nWith NLP, we reduce the infinity of language to something that has a clearly defined structure and set rules. To put it simply, we make language more like chess. Crucially, however, the job isn’t done yet.\\n\\nNLU: playing the language game\\n\\nAssembling the information extracted by NLP, NLU focuses primarily on comprehension: understanding utterances in the context of the broader conversation to choose the right response.\\n\\nparaphrase detection, which determines whether a pair of utterances has the same meaning, and\\n\\ntopic switching, which enables AI to follow a non-linear conversation that naturally jumps around different subjects.\\n\\nFigure 3:\\n\\nNLU goes beyond processing language at face value: it illuminates a user’s underlying intent\\n\\nNLU is an integral part of NLP. If NLP is about understanding the state of the game, NLU is about strategically applying that information to win the game. Thinking dozens of moves ahead is only possible after determining the ground rules and the context. Working together, these two techniques are what makes a conversational AI system a reality. Consider the requests in Figure 3 — NLP’s previous work breaking down utterances into parts, separating the noise, and correcting the typos enable NLU to exactly determine what the users need.\\n\\nFigure 4:\\n\\nBoth NLP and NLU play an important role in understanding a user’s request, but the line where one approach ends and the other begins is blurry\\n\\nThe endgame of language understanding\\n\\nTo win at chess, you need to know the rules, track the changing state of play, and develop a detailed strategy. Understanding language involves the same three elements. And like playing chess, the key is constant improvement. Chess and language present more or less infinite possibilities, and neither have been \"solved\" for good. Yet the more we know, the better decisions we make.\\n\\nBy working diligently to understand the structure and strategy of language, we’ve gained valuable insight into the nature of our communication. Building a computer that perfectly understands us is a massive challenge, but it’s far from impossible — it’s already happening with NLP and NLU.\\n\\nContact  Moveworks to learn how AI can supercharge your workforce productivity.\\n\\ntechnology\\n\\nMore blog posts\\n\\nHow to unlock continual service improvement with AIOps\\n      \\n        \\n          Discover how AIOps transforms IT operations from reactive to proactive.

And how can it help build better AI?\\n\\nNatasha Klein-Atlas, Principal Researcher, Data Annotation\\n\\nKate Lubrano, Annotation Manager\\n\\nJuly 18, 2023\\n\\nlinkedin\\n\\nfacebook\\n\\ntwitter\\n\\nemail\\n\\nFor a long time, chatbots suffered from a negative reputation, primarily due to their frequent misunderstandings of user requests. Many users, subject to the limitations of primitive, script-bound chatbots, longed to speak to live agents who could comprehend their needs the first time around.\\n\\nRecognizing this frustration, artificial intelligence (AI) developers sought solutions to harness the technology\\'s distinguishing capacity to learn and evolve continually, ultimately setting it apart from static, code-dependent software. By tapping into AI\\'s potential, researchers aim to reach the state of dynamic communication tools and leave rigid chatbots behind.\\n\\nThis adaptability employs high-quality annotated data, a crucial ingredient for developing representative, successful, and unbiased AI models.\\n\\nData annotation, the often unsung hero of AI, is the key to reaching excellence. It plays an indispensable role in advancing intelligent conversational AI and fostering chatbots that respond to human language naturally and intuitively.\\n\\nIn this blog post, we aim to illuminate the intriguing world of data annotation and highlight its significance in teaching chatbots to interact seamlessly with users.\\n\\nWe’ll cover:\\n\\nWhat data annotation is and why it’s important\\n\\nThe role annotators play\\n\\nThe main data annotation techniques\\n\\nData annotation applications, including in the enterprise\\n\\nThe limitations of data annotation\\n\\nBest practices for data annotation\\n\\nWhat role AI annotation will play in the future\\n\\nWhat is data annotation?\\n\\nAnnotation provides much-needed context and categorization for machine learning models to extract valuable insights by way of assigning labels to raw data. In this process, a taxonomy — a system of classification — is applied to systematically organize and classify data.\\n\\nData annotation is the backbone of modern AI applications. Its primary function is to help machines comprehend and interpret various forms of data such as text, video, images, or audio. Thanks to this methodical annotation, AI systems can process different types of content effectively.\\n\\nMore specifically, text annotation can be broken down into various tasks, including but not limited to:\\n\\nSemantic annotation: Associates meanings to specific portions of a text, facilitating natural language understanding (NLU).\\n\\nIntent annotation: Identifies the ultimate goal or user needs within user input for improved conversational AI.\\n\\nSentiment annotation: Categorizes emotions expressed in the text, enabling sentiment analysis for chatbots.\\n\\nAs mentioned, annotation encompasses more than just textual formats. For instance, image or video annotation may include classification, which entails categorizing images according to their content; object recognition, which involves identifying and locating specific objects within images or video frames; image segmentation, the process of dividing an image into regions representing distinct objects or areas of interest; and boundary recognition, to further refine object identification.\\n\\nIn this blog, we\\'ll primarily concentrate on text annotation, as it aligns with Moveworks\\' objective of comprehending and interacting with enterprise language. However, please note that annotation is crucial to the advancement of all AI, particularly with the ongoing development of large multimodal models that are able to engage with images, audio, and more.\\n\\nWhy is data annotation important?\\n\\nBefore getting into the importance of data annotation, let\\'s first acknowledge the inherent challenges posed by the ambiguity of human language.\\n\\nPeople articulate their needs in vastly diverse ways — concise or lengthy, jargon-filled or formal. And on top of that, a user’s goals carry more specificity than any taxonomy you apply to them. With seemingly infinite possibilities to convey a message or pose a question, humans can still effortlessly communicate, as they are naturally adept at comprehending linguistic nuances.\\n\\nBut for an untrained AI system, deciphering the essence of such communications can be an arduous task. To illustrate this challenge, consider a colleague who shares a meandering story about their vacation and how they could not access the company portal due to poor Wi-Fi service. Despite various HR-related keywords such as “vacation” and “time off”, a human reader or listener would quickly infer that their issue was an IT problem, not an HR problem.\\n\\nAn untrained bot, in contrast, might struggle to prioritize the most relevant keywords. This is precisely where data annotation steps in. Training AI models on high-quality, annotated data allows them to grasp the complexity and diversity of natural language, separate the signal from the noise, and focus on the most critical aspects of user input.\\n\\nThis becomes particularly important when attempting to predict user\\'s needs based on a chosen taxonomy. Through maintaining a manageable level of granularity in the annotation process, we can improve the decision-making skills of our AI. This method contrasts with approaches used by some, where they assign a single intent to each piece of content, say a knowledge base article, which could lead to reduced productivity and clarity in understanding users\\' needs via a proliferation of intents.\\n\\nIn turn, AI systems and chatbots can accurately respond to a wide range of human communication with minimal effort. Data annotation empowers AI to comprehend the nuanced symptoms users describe and connect them with solutions, cutting through linguistic complexities and delivering elegant solutions.\\n\\nTo sum up, data annotation is an essential component in creating AI systems capable of providing meaningful user experiences. The impact of data annotation spans industries and use cases, significantly enhancing the capabilities and practicality of AI-powered solutions across the board.\\n\\nWhat is the role of annotators?\\n\\nAn AI annotator\\'s role is to systematically review and label different data types, translating human language and inputs into machine-understandable formats. Your brain most likely would automatically determine that if you try your password incorrectly too many times, you may need your account unlocked, but machines require annotated data to effectively learn patterns, make sense of data, and adapt their responses.\\n\\nAnnotated data is particularly crucial for training large language models (LLMs), as their key purpose is to digest, interpret, and generate human-like conversation. Focusing on intent annotation, we define “intent” as the ultimate goal or user need. Intent annotation acts as a bridge between human language and machine language. Annotators review real messages sent to chatbots (utterances) and user-submitted tickets. We do this review while protecting personal and sensitive information, incorporating the principles of privacy by design and by default.\\n\\nAnnotators label these user inputs using a taxonomy that the bot understands and can map to its corresponding actions. For instance, a password resetting issue might be labeled with \"Reset Authentication,\" which triggers the bot\\'s specific skill.\\xa0Through intent annotation, annotators teach the AI system to recognize patterns in seemingly disparate phrasings and accurately respond to meet users’ needs.\\n\\nWhat are the main data annotation techniques?\\n\\nA variety of techniques and approaches are available for annotating your data. In this section, we will discuss the most popular methods - in-house, outsourced, crowdsourced, and AI-driven annotation - and examine the strengths and weaknesses of each.\\n\\nIn-house annotation\\n\\nIn-house annotation involves using your own team of dedicated annotators to process and tag the data, ensuring a high level of control over quality and consistency of the annotations.\\n\\nStrengths:\\n\\nDirect control over the annotation process and quality\\n\\nStronger protection of sensitive or proprietary data\\n\\nFosters a deep understanding of domain-specific data\\n\\nWeaknesses:\\n\\nMay require hiring or training employees, increasing costs\\n\\nLimited scalability, as the team\\'s size can constrict the volume of data to be processed\\n\\nOutsourced annotation\\n\\nOutsourced annotation refers to delegating the data annotation tasks to a third-party provider that specializes in the field, such as a technology consulting firm or a managed services provider.\\n\\nStrengths:\\n\\nAccess to a professional, experienced workforce\\n\\nCost-effective by offloading data annotation expenses\\n\\nRelatively scalable, as third-party providers can accommodate increased workloads\\n\\nWeaknesses:\\n\\nLimited control over the task and potential inconsistency in quality\\n\\nHigher risks for sensitive or classified data, introducing privacy concerns\\n\\nCrowdsourced annotation\\n\\nCrowdsourced annotation \\xa0— a particularly popular approach in the research community —  relies on platforms that gather a large pool of contributors from around the world to annotate data, usually on a pay-per-task model. Amazon Mechanical Turk is one example of crowdsourced annotation platforms.\\n\\nStrengths:\\n\\nAccess to a diverse range of annotators and perspectives\\n\\nExtremely scalable to handle vast quantities of data\\n\\nCost-effective due to the gig economy model\\n\\nWeaknesses:\\n\\nQuality control can be challenging for a number of reasons, as contributors have varying expertise levels\\n\\nMay not be a fit for specialized or highly technical data\\n\\nPrivacy concerns for sensitive or confidential information\\n\\nAI-driven annotation\\n\\nAI-driven annotation employs machine learning algorithms to automatically label the data. Over time, iteratively refining and improving the AI model can achieve higher annotation accuracy.\\n\\nStrengths:\\n\\nRapid annotation of large data volumes\\n\\nCost-effective in the long term\\n\\nWeaknesses:\\n\\nMay require an initial investment in developing an AI model\\n\\nLess adaptability for unanticipated or complex data\\n\\nEthical concerns, including biases in training data that may lead to biased outcomes\\n\\nAnalyzing the strengths and weaknesses of each technique empowers you to make informed decisions that best suit your project requirements, budget, and time constraints.\\n\\nWhat are the applications of data annotation?\\n\\nData annotation has far-reaching implications across various industries. In teaching AI models to proficiently engage with user interactions, many businesses can leverage the power of annotated data to drive innovation, improve customer experience, and optimize processes. Below, we delve into some of the most notable applications of data annotation, spanning sectors such as medical, retail, finance, legal, automotive, industrial, and employee support.\\n\\nMedical: In the medical industry, annotated data enables AI systems to analyze medical images, electronic health records, and diagnostic data. Examples of applications include detecting diseases in radiology scans, predicting patient outcomes, and creating personalized treatment plans.

By training AI models to accurately understand user requests, machine learning-driven platforms can offer seamless assistance with IT support, HR issues, and other workplace tasks, enhancing the overall employee experience.\\n\\nAs illustrated by these applications, data annotation is at the core of AI-driven innovations, empowering industries to leverage machine learning and usher in a new era of smart solutions. The right investment in data annotation can pave the way to unparalleled growth, revolutionizing businesses across diverse sectors.\\n\\nWhy is data annotation important in an enterprise context?\\n\\nIn an enterprise setting, AI systems are expected to perform at their best, adapting to specific use cases and delivering fluid experiences for customers and employees alike.\\n\\nFor AI to thrive in this context, it must be proficient in dealing with complex situations, recognizing domain-specific terminology, and making accurate inferences based on user input. Data annotation is deeply involved in achieving these high performance standards, as it is necessary for AI models to smoothly adapt to unique enterprise use cases.\\n\\nEffective data annotation assists AI systems in better understanding various contexts within the enterprise realm, such as:\\n\\nIndustry-specific terminology: Enterprises often use domain-specific jargon and abbreviations unique to their industry or organization. Annotating data relevant to these terms teaches AI systems to develop a comprehensive repository of the language typically used in the enterprise environment.\\n\\nAmbiguous requests: AI-driven customer support and chatbots need to interpret user requests accurately in real time while dealing with a wide array of inquiries. Data annotation ensures these systems understand the nuances of human language and are capable of providing appropriate responses to various customer needs.\\n\\nData security and compliance: Enterprises that handle sensitive data, such as financial or health information, require AI solutions that comply with regulatory requirements. Annotating data to train AI models in detecting, protecting, and handling such information is crucial in adhering to privacy and security standards.\\n\\nDomain-specific AI applications: AI applications designed for specialized enterprise use cases rely on annotated data tailored to each specific domain for optimal performance. Examples of these use cases include fraud detection in finance, predictive maintenance in manufacturing, or document analysis in legal contexts.\\n\\nClearly, data annotation is a vital aspect of any enterprise AI endeavor. The process of annotating data allows AI systems to adapt to organization-specific demands and complexities, delivering custom solutions that cater to unique use cases. Investing time and resources into data annotation facilitates successful AI adoption, transforming operations and customer interactions aligned with the ever-evolving digital landscape.\\n\\nData annotation limitations\\n\\nData annotation can be hindered by challenges such as cost, accuracy, and ambiguity. Here’s a quick run-through of these limitations and the ways annotators and enterprises can work together to overcome these obstacles.\\n\\nCost\\n\\nOne of the primary challenges encountered in data annotation is the financial cost associated with hiring and training annotators. Investing in annotators ensures high-quality annotations that lead to improved AI system performance. Striking a balance between securing adequate resources for annotators and managing organizational constraints is essential for maintaining an efficient annotation process.\\n\\nAccuracy\\n\\nEnsuring the accuracy of annotated data is crucial for the efficacy of AI models. Mislabeled datasets can negatively impact AI performance, leading to undesirable outcomes, such as incorrect predictions or responses. Annotators and enterprises must continuously monitor and maintain the quality of annotations to ensure AI models are trained on the most accurate, current, and relevant data.\\n\\nAmbiguity\\n\\nOne of the greatest challenges of annotation is dealing with ambiguity. Words, acronyms, and abbreviations can have multiple meanings. Annotators are able to consider the organization and the industry that the utterance or ticket they are evaluating originated from, which can help narrow things down. The same acronym could be referring to a particular form at one organization but an internal software tool at another.\\n\\nIn some cases, annotators are able to reference more specific customer language resource documents in order to classify a resource type of a potentially ambiguous term with more accuracy. The type of company a user works for can also be important to consider when determining intent.\\n\\nFor example, while at most organizations served by Moveworks utterances discussing health insurance are likely to fall into our “Benefits” Resource label, if we know the organization is a health insurance provider we may need to read deeper into the utterance to determine if it is about insurance being provided to an external client.\\n\\nContextual awareness\\n\\nFurther complicating annotation is the fact that each utterance can be considered individually, without the context of the conversation history. Annotators must then assess and annotate single utterances without having this context, which can occasionally make it difficult to infer the intended meaning.\\n\\nAmbiguity is added when messages are cut off by a user hitting Enter too soon, or in cases where a user is referencing something previously discussed with vague terms such as “it” instead of naming the actual resource. In these cases, annotation can feel like an exercise in mind reading, but expert annotators are typically able to make educated guesses based on their experience reviewing similar utterances.\\n\\nDisagreement resolution and quality control\\n\\nDisagreement resolution is a process of addressing both annotator errors and valid interpretive differences in opinion, ensuring data consistency, as well as refining guidelines. By analyzing differing interpretations of user inputs, annotators can improve annotation quality.\\n\\nHistorically, collecting multiple opinions and resolving disagreements has helped us correct annotator errors, identify ambiguous inputs, and refine project documentation. This process has also led to better taxonomy definitions, minimizing biases while enabling the AI to ask clarifying questions when needed.\\n\\nIn pursuit of efficiency, the Moveworks team has reduced time spent on disagreement resolution, instead aiming for an 85% organic agreement rate. Continuous improvements have resulted in consistently reaching or even exceeding this goal, achieving high-quality data to train AI models effectively.\\n\\nWhat are some best practices for data annotation?\\n\\nData annotation is a critical process for creating high-quality labeled datasets used in many machine learning applications. To ensure the accuracy and consistency of annotations, it is important to establish clear guidelines for annotators to follow. This will lead to increased efficiency while helping maintain a robust quality control process. The following is a list of key best practices that you should consider when starting the annotation process.\\n\\nPrepare detailed and easy-to-read instructions: Provide articulate guidelines for your annotators to follow, including examples and edge cases. This will help avoid confusion and ensure that annotators understand how to handle various scenarios, leading to more accurate annotations.\\n\\nSupport humans with machines: Leverage machine learning techniques, such as automated pre-annotations, to provide a starting point for human annotators. Machine-generated suggestions can save time and help achieve consistent results, allowing annotators to focus on refining the outcome and handling more complex cases.\\n\\nFocus on quality: Ensure you have a robust quality control process in place throughout the data annotation project. This may involve periodic reviews, inter-annotator agreement measurements, and addressing discrepancies, which can improve the accuracy and consistency of the final dataset.\\n\\nStay compliant: Be mindful of privacy policies, regulations, and ethical considerations when annotating data. This includes proper data anonymization and following guidelines relevant to specific domains such as finance, healthcare, or education.\\n\\nIterate and update guidelines: Data annotation is an ongoing process. As you gather more data and feedback, update the guidelines accordingly to address new challenges and scenarios. Keep your guidelines current and ensure that annotators are informed of any changes, maintaining consistency and adaptability over time.\\n\\nSelect the right annotation tools and techniques: Choose the best tools and methodologies for your specific data annotation project as capable and precise tools make the process annotator-friendly. This may vary depending on the type of data, the project\\'s scope, and other factors. Having the right tools can streamline the annotation process and improve efficiency.\\n\\nEncourage communication and collaboration: Facilitate open communication between annotators and project managers. Address questions and provide regular feedback, helping minimize errors, and fostering a collaborative environment for annotators to learn from each other and make improvements.\\n\\nDiversify your annotator team: Having a diverse range of perspectives among your annotators can reduce bias in your dataset. Ensure that your training data is annotated by people with different backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets to increase overall quality and impact.\\n\\nSet realistic goals and timelines: Establish specific, measurable, and achievable goals for your data annotation project. Ensure that project deadlines are realistic and considerate of the resources available. This will help manage expectations, keep the team motivated, and deliver a high-quality annotated dataset in a timely manner.\\n\\nThe impact of AI annotation in the future\\n\\nAs AI technology continues to rapidly evolve, AI-powered data annotation is poised to play a significant role in reshaping various industries and transforming the way data is processed, organized, and utilized.\\n\\nHere\\'s an overview of the potential impact of AI annotation in the future:\\n\\nScalability: AI-driven annotation can help scale the data annotation process exponentially, reducing the reliance on human annotators and decreasing the time required for annotation tasks. This will enable organizations to process larger volumes of data at unprecedented speeds, ultimately fueling faster AI system development and deployment.\\n\\nIncreased annotation efficiency and accuracy: Advanced machine learning algorithms will be able to both automate and enhance the quality of annotations, minimizing errors and inconsistencies. As AI systems become more intelligent, the gap between human and machine-generated annotations will contract, with AI models increasingly handling complex tasks with ease.\\n\\nPersonalized AI models: With more annotated data, AI systems will be able to learn from diverse user experiences and preferences, paving the way for highly personalized models. Tailoring AI outputs to individual users will greatly benefit industries such as healthcare, education, marketing, and customer service, promoting a more engaging and customized user experience.\\n\\nGreater accessibility to AI technologies: The democratization of AI-powered data annotation will lower barriers to entry for organizations looking to harness AI capabilities. With faster and more cost-effective annotation options, even smaller entities and startups can access and utilize advanced AI technologies across various domains.\\n\\nEthical AI with reduced bias: As AI-driven annotation processes evolve, creating unbiased and ethically sound AI models will be of paramount importance. Diversifying training data can help achieve more representative and unbiased systems that consider a wide range of perspectives and serve a broader audience. However, this approach is not without risks. It’s also possible that depending exclusively on AI annotation will only perpetuate biases on a larger scale.\\n\\nData annotation will only get more important with the rise of AI\\n\\nData annotation is integral to the development of advanced AI systems and chatbots that interact seamlessly with users. By understanding the intricacies of data annotation, we can empower AI to comprehend and empathize with users, cutting through linguistic complexities and delivering optimal solutions across diverse industries.\\n\\nWith the right investment in data annotation, we can also establish a foundation for unparalleled growth, revolutionizing businesses across the board.

Everything from company policies to user permissions to knowledge articles is in constant flux. New resources get added every day, while others become obsolete. And even the most relevant resource for a Canadian employee on the Sales team might not help an engineer in France. Without considering all of this nuance, automation projects often fail to get off the ground.\\n\\nMoveworks is the first AI platform that’s purpose-built to automate support for the world’s largest companies. And today, we’re announcing major enhancements to our platform, designed specifically to handle these complex environments.\\n\\nAt the core of this announcement is Adaptive Response, a technique that enables our bot to serve up a completely custom answer based on user context and past feedback. We’re also announcing expanded integrations, a context-aware permissions system, and the ability to hand off high-touch issues to a live service desk agent. Collectively, the enhancements allow large companies to deliver instant and effortless support to their employees, with a single AI platform that keeps pace as their business evolves.\\n\\nRead the full announcement here.\\n\\nAdaptive Response\\n\\nSeemingly simple issues often demand complex solutions. A lot of behind-the-scenes effort is needed to answer, “What’s the policy for taking time off?” And while a conventional chatbot would likely provide one, pre-programmed response in every situation, Moveworks takes a deeply personalized and contextual approach to support, one which adapts as companies change.\\n\\nWith Adaptive Response, Moveworks has taken this approach to the next level: automatically generating customized responses to each issue, based on all available resources, in real time. Building on our existing conversational AI system, Adaptive Response allows Moveworks to offer up multiple solutions when useful — for instance, a form and two knowledge articles — in a format that’s optimized to resolve support issues as quickly as possible:\\n\\nFigure 1: Adaptive Response gives Moveworks the ability to completely customize its responses, from the resources it surfaces to even the format of the response itself.\\n\\nWhen someone asks Moveworks about PTO, our bot considers everything from current context to user feedback, then provides the best, most up-to-date resources for that person. In Figure 1, Moveworks serves up two resources — a knowledge article and a form — that are tailor-made for the contractor who needs help.\\n\\nCritically, Adaptive Response also accounts for the fact that answers change. \\xa0If in two weeks this contractor is hired to work full time, his answer would be drastically different. On top of this, new resources are added, and old ones are retired all the time. At a company with thousands of knowledge articles, forms, and workflows, keeping track of so many solutions can be a frustrating and manual job. But by leveraging Adaptive Response and constantly incorporating new information, Moveworks finds the ideal path to resolution, without involving the service desk.\\n\\nIntegrations\\n\\nSupport teams expend a huge amount of effort to painstakingly build out their knowledge bases. The problem is that every department has its own specialized tool — the HR team might keep its knowledge in Simpplr, the IT team in Confluence, and the Finance team in SharePoint. As a result, employees struggle to track down the information they need to stay productive.\\n\\nThat’s why Moveworks is expanding its integrations with Simpplr, Cherwell, Freshservice, and SharePoint on-premises. Now, when employees have questions, Moveworks can serve up a precise snippet of information from within any of these tools, or even multiple snippets if helpful. So instead of searching through endless systems or filing a support ticket, employees can simply describe any issue to Moveworks — directly in Microsoft Teams or Slack — and get an answer in seconds, all without any manual configuration.\\n\\nPermissions\\n\\nOne of the biggest challenges in automating support is that different users have different permissions. Making sure that only authorized users can see restricted content isn’t something that simple, pre-programmed chatbots do well. In fact, even for the service desk, it can be incredibly difficult to ensure that information always ends up in the right hands.\\n\\nFigure 2: Moveworks considers the unique permissions of each user, such as their position, seniority, and employment status.\\n\\nAs of this release, we’ve revamped our permissions system to ensure that only authorized employees see sensitive content. Our platform can now restrict access based on location, seniority, department, and other important factors, understanding complex layers of user information to provide individualized support automatically. And because Moveworks can ingest existing access control roles from service desk systems, like ServiceNow, incorporating permissions into the platform is straightforward for support teams.\\n\\nLive Agent Handoff\\n\\nMoveworks automates a high percentage of issues all by itself, but some situations will always require a person to step in and help out.\\n\\nUsing natural language understanding (NLU) to understand employees' requests, Moveworks works with Vayusphere to make a seamless handoff to a live service desk agent — automatically triaging issues to the right expert. With this new approach, employees get support from the right expert directly in their enterprise chat platform.\\n\\nFigure 3: Moveworks streamlines the handoff to a live service desk agent via a deep integration with Vayusphere.\\n\\nAt Moveworks, we’re constantly working to unravel the complexities of today’s digital world. And that means resolving every request for help — IT, HR, finance, facilities, or otherwise — completely and autonomously.\\n\\nEach of the innovations we’ve announced today plays a role in giving employees one simple place to go for help. Anyone can ask a question in plain English and get what they need to get the job done. Moving forward, we’ll continue to find new and creative ways to solve support issues faster, no matter the complexity.\\n\\nRequest a demo to see the Moveworks platform in action.\\n\\nproduct features\\n\\nMore blog posts\\n\\nHow to unlock continual service improvement with AIOps\\n      \\n        \\n          Discover how AIOps transforms IT operations from reactive to proactive.

Thought leader after thought leader is sounding off about the importance of investing in a slew of machine learning-powered tools, practically shouting from the rooftops about the transformational impact of AI-powered chatbots in the workplace.\\n\\nRegardless of all the buzz around conversational AI, there’s little information out there on what it can actually do. Resources for creating your own conversational AI strategy or even details on everyday use cases are limited.\\n\\nToday, I’m here to show you that conversational AI is more than just a buzzword. It’s a powerful tool that can make an immediate impact across your organization. Companies like Palo Alto Networks and DocuSign are already using this technology to reshape every aspect of how their teams get help at work. The immediate, real-time support provided by conversational AI powers employee comms, offers insight into common issues, and much more — leaving employees more time to focus on higher impact work. So let me introduce you to a fraction of what’s possible with conversational AI on day one.\\n\\nConversational AI offers instant support\\n\\nThe power of conversational AI lies in its ability to respond dynamically. It isn’t limited by dialog flows or pre-scripted solutions. An AI-powered chatbot can help you perform complex, multistep tasks like setting up PTO, troubleshooting Adobe Acrobat, or submitting an expense report — without forcing you to learn a new interface. It immediately understands user requests and responds in seconds.\\n\\nTroubleshoot common questions\\n\\nA major reason employees reach out to their IT or HR team is just to get basic questions answered. Conversational AI can resolve common issues autonomously, freeing support teams up to address higher-priority work.\\n\\nProvision software\\n\\nWith conversational AI, you can autonomously provision, or de-provision, the software your employees need to get work done. Instead of spending an hour on the phone with IT, they can ask a chatbot for access and receive a response in as little as seconds.\\n\\nManage permissions\\n\\nEven the most capable support teams can find it difficult to keep track of hundreds of different users and all their permissions. When an employee asks for access to Tableau, a deeply integrated conversational AI can offer up a personalized solution, depending on that employee’s access level.\\n\\nUnlock accounts\\n\\nBy integrating with identity management systems like Active Directory and Okta, conversational AI can proactively message employees to prevent lockouts and securely restore access with no help desk involvement.\\n\\nFill forms\\n\\nConversational AI makes it possible for employees to fill out and submit forms directly in their chat platform, using natural language. Filling forms — a process that once involved many different platforms and steps — can be completed quickly and conversationally.\\n\\nReset passwords\\n\\nLarge enterprises typically handle several thousand password issues every month. With conversational AI, employees can reset passwords by asking a chatbot for help, meaning thousands fewer IT tickets to worry about.\\n\\nAccelerate approvals\\n\\nConversational AI can automatically route approvals to the right hands. Managers can easily accept or deny access using natural language, ensuring that employees get what they need, from software to PTO, quickly and securely.\\n\\nConversational AI inspires action\\n\\nCompanies use a range of strategies to communicate with their employees en masse, but usually it comes down to firing off a bunch of emails. Even if your people pay attention to their inboxes, this approach doesn’t make it easy for employees to ask follow-up questions provide information to your comms team on who’s acted and who hasn’t. Conversational AI flips the script, turning one-way messages into two-way conversations.\\n\\nAnswer follow-up questions\\n\\nEmployees will always have questions when their company launches a new policy or updates a security protocol. Whereas an email is a dead-end, when you send a message with a chatbot, you’re sending an expert capable of answering any follow-up questions.\\n\\nOnboard new employees\\n\\nOn their first day at a job, new hires drown in information. By sending onboarding materials via a conversational chatbot, employees can start their jobs right — with the ability to prioritize top-of-mind questions on day one.\\n\\nSend targeted follow-up messages\\n\\nYour campaign doesn’t end after you send your message. Conversational AI offers visibility into your comm’s performance. When you know who’s seen it and who’s taken action, you can send a targeted reminder to ensure that the change you want to happen happens.\\n\\nConversational AI kickstarts improvement\\n\\nSolving a support issue involves multiple conversations between employees and service desks. But when each issue is considered a unique, individual problem, it’s hard to see the big picture. By handling this back-and-forth over chat, conversational AI resolves issues faster, minimizing support wait times and, even more critically, offering unique insights into how to improve existing systems.\\n\\nProactively identify recurring issues\\n\\nEvery company has common support issues, from troubleshooting the VPN to getting a Zoom Pro license. AI can offer insight into the issues employees have so that your team can build the right resources and make it even easier for everyone to get the specific help they need.\\n\\nTriage issues to the right experts\\n\\nMany companies have hundreds or even thousands of assignment groups, meaning that service desk agents struggle to determine where to route issues. A chatbot solves common support issues instantly, but when expert help is needed — AI understands and routes requests to the right assignment group.\\n\\nAutomate the entire ticket lifecycle\\n\\nSupport tickets can take forever to solve because they involve multiple conversations between employees and service desks. But conversational AI handles back-and-forth autonomously. From updating employees to nudging agents to closing tickets, AI makes support seamless.\\n\\nConversational AI is limitless\\n\\nI’ve only covered 13 conversational AI use cases here. But the applications are limitless. It makes it possible for support teams to completely eliminate common pain points, allowing new hires to ramp up quickly and long-time employees to grow.\\n\\nConversational AI isn’t just about automating onboarding tasks or expediting approvals. Rather, it allows support teams to make thousands of tiny improvements in real time, transforming the employee experience.\\n\\nAs more and more organizations recognize people as their greatest assets, company leaders have come to realize that they need to do more than drop buzzwords.

They include a self-learning conversational AI technique, Adaptive Response, which generates customized responses to employees\\' requests in real time. Critically, the technique allows Moveworks to offer more than one relevant solution — for instance, a form plus a knowledge article — and to adapt future responses based on usage data.\\n\\nMoveworks also announced deep integrations with Simpplr, Cherwell, Freshservice, and SharePoint on-premises; it can search these knowledge bases for the snippet-sized answers to employees\\' questions. In addition, Moveworks now understands the security permissions of each user, ensuring that the right resources end up in the right hands. The enhanced platform is designed to keep pace as companies evolve, from automatically ingesting knowledge articles to dynamically creating responses.\\n\\n\"Employees expect to get help right away,\" said Moveworks CTO Vaibhav Nivargi. \"But in the context of a dynamic enterprise, identifying the forms, knowledge articles, and workflows they need is a profoundly difficult problem for machine learning. Moveworks is the first platform engineered to solve that problem. Between our new integrations, our robust security controls, and our unscripted approach to conversation, we\\'ve automated support for the world\\'s largest companies.\"\\n\\nAdaptive Response\\n\\nBy contrast, Moveworks\\' conversational AI system, Dynamic Flow™, generates responses on the fly, considering a wealth of context to deliver personalized and up-to-date resources. Adaptive Response further improves Dynamic Flow by offering a ranked spectrum of relevant solutions when useful, such as in the example above, so employees can select their own path to resolution. In these cases, more than 15\\xa0percent\\xa0of requests are resolved by a resource other than the top-ranked option, resulting in even more precise support.\\n\\nIntegrations\\n\\n20 percent of the workday\\xa0looking for internal information.\\n\\nMoveworks eliminates this trade-off: the platform automatically ingests articles from every department\\'s knowledge base — without any manual configuration — and then answers employees\\' questions from a single interface on Microsoft Teams or Slack. Now, Moveworks can provide just the most useful snippets of information from Simpplr, Cherwell, Freshservice, and SharePoint on-premises, thanks to expanded integrations.\\n\\nPermissions\\n\\nLive Agent Handoff\\n\\n\"This deep integration between Moveworks and Vayusphere allows employees to get support in seconds, right from their favorite messaging tool,\" said Vayusphere CEO Pushpendra Mohta. \"By using AI to understand employees\\' requests, Moveworks makes the handoff to a live service desk agent seamless. The platform selects the right expert automatically, so even complicated support issues get solved right away.\"\\n\\nAbout Moveworks\\n\\nDocuSign, Hearst, Broadcom, Autodesk, Equinix, and Palo Alto Networks to move forward on what matters.\\n\\nMedia Contact\\n\\nSophia Xepoleas, Sr PR Manager\\n\\nEmail:\\n\\npr@moveworks.ai\\n\\nWeb:\\n\\nMoveworks.com/contact\\n\\nSolutions\\n\\nCustomers\\n\\nResources\\n\\nBlog\\n\\nSitemap\\n\\nPlatform\\n\\nPlatform overview\\n\\nMoveworks API\\n\\nSystem status\\n\\nCompany\\n\\nAbout us\\n\\nNewsroom\\n\\nContact us\\n\\nCareers\\n\\n©2023 Moveworks, Inc.\\n\\nPrivacy policies', metadata={'source': 'https://www.moveworks.com/press-releases/2021/07/moveworks-enhances-conversational-ai-platform'}),\n",

It gives CIOs an actionable to-do list based on which initiatives will maximize productivity and ROI.\\n\\nToday, business leaders face an impossible task: Increase operational efficiency, improve the employee experience, and do it all without first understanding what’s slowing employees down. A\\xa0recent report\\xa0found that 82% of leaders acknowledge that employees will consider leaving if their current employer does not provide access to the tools, technology, or information they need to do their jobs well. Nearly three in five employees who do experience this frustration said it makes them less productive. And yet, none of these leaders have had visibility into what’s slowing productivity and what’s not, so their ability to actually fix these problems is limited — until now.\\n\\nEmployee Experience Insights uses advanced techniques in NLU and machine learning to analyze and categorize data coming in from customers’ ITSM systems. It offers CIOs granular insights into the biggest issues plaguing each employee persona — allowing leaders across every department to remove inefficiencies and resolve employees’ frustrations in real time. And, while current ITSM insights tools focus primarily on tickets and SLAs, EXI focuses entirely on people, which means businesses now have answers to critical questions, like:\\n\\nWhich apps do employees need access to on day one?\\n\\nWhat are the biggest issues remote employees are running into?\\n\\nWhat are the most common issues employees spend time troubleshooting?\\n\\nHow long is Sales waiting for support for critical issues, vs. Engineering, vs. Marketing?\\n\\nHow does our performance compare to industry standards and internal benchmarks?\\n\\n\"At Databricks, we know the right data and AI can transform how an organization does business,\" said Naveen Zutshi, CIO of Databricks. “My job is to empower our digital workforce with the tools and technologies they need to perform at their best. With Moveworks\\' sophisticated NLU and Employee Experience Insights, we have meaningful and actionable data to turn thousands of requests into an efficient plan of action and a best-in-class employee experience.\"\\n\\nEmployee Experience Insights\\xa0relies on Moveworks’\\xa0proprietary NLU models\\xa0to understand and categorize each employee issue. While most out-of-the-box NLU models are only able to categorize 20 - 30% of a company’s tickets when attempting this same analysis, Moveworks’ NLU models are able to categorize 100% of them. That’s because our models are trained on three different sources:\\n\\nBest-in-class language models:\\xa0Language is complex, nuanced, and often challenging for machines to accurately decipher.\\xa0That’s why the Moveworks platform is built on a foundation of best-in-class language models — like BERT and GPT — that enable it to interpret the infinite nuance of human language.\\n\\nEmployee support requests:\\xa0Employees use different language at work than they do in their personal lives. Moveworks is trained on over 400M employee support requests, which allow it to discern how employees communicate in their day-to-day work environments.\\n\\nCustomer data:\\xa0Each company has its own unique language — whether it’s the name of their Wi-Fi network, or the names and titles of each employee. Moveworks is trained on each customer’s unique entities to ensure it can detect what the employee needs in their own environment.\\n\\n“Every help desk is sitting on a treasure trove of information that could prevent future issues, before they happen,” said Bhavin Shah, CEO of Moveworks. “But business leaders have not yet been able to extract value from this data because the majority of AI models fail to understand the vast ambiguity of human language. Recent advancements in NLU have changed that — and it’s a milestone that will fundamentally change the way business leaders make decisions moving forward.”\\n\\nTo schedule a demo of Employee Experience Insights, visit:\\xa0https://www.moveworks.com/request-demo\\n\\nMedia Contact\\n\\nSophia Xepoleas, Sr PR Manager\\n\\nEmail:\\n\\npr@moveworks.ai\\n\\nWeb:\\n\\nMoveworks.com/contact\\n\\nSolutions\\n\\nCustomers\\n\\nResources\\n\\nBlog\\n\\nSitemap\\n\\nPlatform\\n\\nPlatform overview\\n\\nMoveworks API\\n\\nSystem status\\n\\nCompany\\n\\nAbout us\\n\\nNewsroom\\n\\nContact us\\n\\nCareers\\n\\n©2023 Moveworks, Inc.\\n\\nPrivacy policies', metadata={'source': 'https://www.moveworks.com/press-releases/2022/10/moveworks-launches-employee-experience-insights-to-help-cios-identify-and-prioritize-high-impact-initiatives'}),\n",

And I suspect that decision-makers across industries and geographies have all felt similarly pressured to take advantage of this new tech ASAP.\\n\\nOf course, a few of these products are genuinely impressive. Others are essentially layering on top of the models built by OpenAI which underpin ChatGPT, and most are somewhere in between. But all of them, unfortunately, are designed to amaze non-experts during a demo.\\n\\nThat said — given the costs and risks associated with deploying any new tech, let alone something as complex as AI — it’s crucial to make sure that your investment is sound in order to maximize ROI and minimize risk.\\n\\nSo here’s the question: At a time when every product is “the ChatGPT of _______,” how can you decide which ones to trust?\\n\\nMy aim is to provide you with:\\n\\nAn understanding of why conversational AI is difficult to assess.\\n\\nFive questions that can help you cut through the noise and make more informed purchasing decisions.\\n\\nThe red flags you should watch out for in AI demos.\\n\\nWhy it’s hard to evaluate conversational AI platforms without a demo\\n\\nAs consumers, we're accustomed to evaluating products based on their features. This is a perfectly reasonable approach for familiar products like cars, where questions like “does it have heated seats” and “can the trunk fit a large bike” can help us make an informed purchase decision.\\n\\nHowever, when it comes to AI products, the feature-based approach falls short. Take self-driving cars, for example. It's easy to get caught up in the car's impressive capabilities, such as its ability to change lanes with ease or stop on a dime. But simply having these features doesn't necessarily mean the car will keep you safe in the real world or perform well in a live environment.\\n\\nInstead, when evaluating AI products, it's crucial to take a more holistic approach. This means looking beyond the features to assess the product's overall effectiveness and reliability in real-world scenarios. It also means asking questions about the underlying technology and algorithms, the data sets used to train the AI, and the product's track record in scaling actual deployments.\\n\\nBy taking this approach, we can all avoid getting swept up in the hype around AI products and make more informed decisions that are grounded in reality. Ultimately, this will help ensure that we're getting the most value out of AI technology while also minimizing risk.\\n\\nThe 5 questions to ask in your next conversational AI platform demo\\n\\nWith so many conversational AI startups vying for your attention, asking the right questions can distinguish genuine conversational AI from mere imitations. Relying solely on lists of features can be misleading as they may not accurately reflect the product's real-world performance in your environment. It's important to look beyond the surface level and ask relevant questions that can reveal potential issues and ensure informed decision-making.\\n\\nTo make the most of your conversational AI demo, consider asking these five critical questions that can help you gain a deeper understanding of the product's capabilities and potential limitations:\\n\\n1. Can I get an interactive demo using my own data?\\n\\nWhen vendors provide demos, they often use their own data to showcase their system's capabilities, which may not accurately reflect how the platform will perform with your unique data.\\n\\nWhile the vendor's demo may appear impressive, it's essential to test the system with your data to determine if it's the right fit for your needs. And by using your own data, you can make sure that any analysis they provide uses their production models and processes, rather than any behind-the-scenes wizardry.\\n\\nBy testing the system with your data, you'll have a better understanding of its performance and how it can handle your specific use cases. This approach allows you to identify any potential issues or limitations before making a purchase, saving you time and money in the long run.\\n\\n2. How are you using large language models?\\n\\nMany conversational AI vendors will say, “We use GPT-3!” without being able to dive deeper into why large language models (LLMs) are a critical part of any conversational AI product.\\n\\nEnterprise conversational AI requires the ability to understand the specific language used in that workplace. It may be challenging for vendors to develop on their own due to a lack of sufficient data. And it may be equally challenging for vendors who are just an interface on top of an LLM to answer business-related queries. A demo would reveal the limits of that understanding immediately.\\n\\nThis question can also reveal how well-integrated and up-to-date the vendor’s technology is. Given how fast this space is moving, it's important to know how many LLMs have been retired and how often new ones are added to their stack. A vendor simply saying they use LLMs is not enough, as the best and most efficient models are constantly evolving.\\n\\n3.\\xa0What tangible value are you bringing to customers?\\n\\nIt's important to understand the tangible value a vendor is bringing to customers before investing in a product. Don't just take their word for it — ask for reference calls with current customers to get a better understanding of their experience with the product, how it’s performing, and how long it took to get them to that point. Or even better, ask them for a brief demo. This can give you a glimpse into how the product has impacted their business, what benefits they have seen, and any areas of improvement.\\n\\n4.\\xa0What’s your team's expertise with conversational AI?\\n\\nDeploying large language models (LLMs) in production is a complex process that requires an advanced Machine Learning Ops platform, a team of human annotators to generate training data, and skilled engineers to optimize performance. It’s not something that’s going to happen overnight.\\n\\nIf a company has no prior experience using LLMs, it may take years to build the necessary infrastructure. However, companies with a history of using LLMs are in a better position to quickly adopt the capabilities of this technology in their products. This is to say that it’s important to inquire about a vendor's experience with LLMs and their ability to deploy them in production as it can provide insight into the vendor’s expertise and whether they are equipped to handle the complexities of LLM deployment.\\n\\n5. What security measures are in place to protect our data?\\n\\nWith the rise of data breaches and cyber attacks, it's essential to know that your data is secure. Ensure that the vendor has a clear and comprehensive security plan in place, including measures such as data encryption, access control, and regular security audits.\\n\\nAdditionally, ask about any compliance certifications or regulations that the vendor adheres to, such as HIPAA or FedRAMP, to ensure that they are meeting industry standards for data protection. By asking these questions, you can gain a better understanding of the security measures in place and make an informed decision about the safety of your data.\\n\\n3 conversational AI demo red flags\\n\\nIn addition to asking the five questions above, look out for the following AI demo red flags:\\n\\nOverconfidence: Products that appear overly confident in their performance during a demo are likely to be hard-coded.\\n\\nUndermanagement: On the other end of the spectrum, AI products do require some fixed controls and regulations when the stakes are high. For example, enterprise-grade conversational AI should take into consideration all existing access control lists, permissions, and processes to ensure sensitive information is never shared with unauthorized users. Don’t trust products that delegate such decisions to probabilistic models, no matter how smart they claim to be.\\n\\nInflexibility: A great feature is useless if it struggles with normal variance.

So we’ve rounded up some highlights to help you catch up.\\n\\nMoveworks is the enterprise copilot platform\\n\\nMoveworks Live kicked off with CEO Bhavin Shah sharing our vision of language as the primary interface between people and systems in the enterprise world. He emphasized that AI has transitioned from a \"nice-to-have\" to a business imperative, playing a crucial role in various industries.\\n\\nThis opening presentation took attendees on a journey through the evolution of AI technology, highlighting the remarkable resurgence of AI as an essential component of employee experience and how the transformer model invention and other milestones contributed to the rapid digital transformation in recent years.\\n\\nBhavin ended by setting the stage for the event by discussing the potential of AI — and specifically, AI copilots — to streamline work processes, improve the employee experience, and promote productivity across multiple departments. Using natural language, employees can effortlessly connect to several business systems and change the way work is done.\\n\\nThe opening section of Moveworks Live served as a powerful introduction to the transformative potential of conversational AI, inviting participants to explore how this technology will shape the future of work.\\n\\nHow to craft your AI copilot strategy\\n\\nWe understand that businesses are looking for ways to leverage large language models (LLMs) effectively to create a tailored strategy. That’s why at Moveworks Live, CTO Vaibhav Nivargi shared a simple four-tier copilot framework to help you understand the level of investment and technology needed to build your copilot, depending on the specific use cases:\\n\\nTier 1: Copilots that address persona-specific use cases focused on generation (e.g., writing web copy) or simple analysis, achieved through a single API call to one LLM.\\n\\nTier 2: Copilots that manage domain-specific use cases. This approach involves fine-tuning an LLM to understand domain-specific language and incorporating enterprise context (e.g., building a knowledge base of legal documents).\\n\\nTier 3: Copilots that deal with multi-step, domain-specific problems. This is achieved by stacking multiple LLMs and optimizing processes (e.g., helping sales teams follow up on specific accounts).\\n\\nTier 4: Copilots which address enterprise-wide problems. Solving these widespread challenges requires building an LLM stack that combines all the techniques from Tiers 1-3 at a wider scale — in addition to adding enterprise-grade security, better reasoning capabilities, identity management, permissions, and analytics.\\n\\nWe would be remiss to not mention the announcement of our new language model, MoveLM™, designed explicitly for enterprise tasks. This model has been trained with high-quality enterprise data that has been aggregated over the past six years. We developed this data set by analyzing 500 million tickets, facilitating approximately 14 million bot conversations, and ingesting 401,215 knowledge base articles and 36,066 forms. MoveLM™ will be layered into our existing stack, performing alongside best-in-class models like MPNet and GPT-4.\\n\\nMoveLM™ has two variations: a 7 billion parameter version that allows for a higher degree of customization and a 175 billion parameter version with enhanced reasoning capabilities.\\n\\nGenerate any conversational AI use case with Creator Studio\\n\\nMoveworks Live gave us an opportunity to showcase our just-launched Creator Studio. Leveraging best-in-class language models, Creator Studio enables users to generate and fully deploy any conversational AI use case — without the need for building dialog flow or writing scripts.\\n\\nThe platform consists of three main workspaces — Paths, Queries, and Events — which enable companies to connect their people and systems through the universal UI of language:\\n\\nPaths Workspace eliminates the need for toolkits and empowers enterprise architects, service owners, and developers to generate fluid, yet controlled, conversations with ease.\\n\\nQueries Workspace allows employees to instantly access the information they need from across a fragmented enterprise ecosystem.\\n\\nEvents Workspace helps businesses run more smoothly by sending proactive, action-oriented messages to employees straight from business systems.\\n\\nThis session included a selection of demos featuring each of these workspaces to let attendees experience Creator Studio’s ease of use, speed, and adaptability.\\n\\nWe realize it\\'s crucial to incorporate conversational AI into every organization\\'s tech stack to keep up with the changing technological landscape. Boards around the world seem to be requiring CEOs to integrate conversational AI into every facet of their business, and this session provides a firsthand look into the potential of Creator Studio and its ability to transform the way companies create and manage conversational AI across the enterprise.\\n\\nMake informed decisions with natural language analytics\\n\\nEmployee Experience Insights (EXI) harnesses Moveworks\\' expertise in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and large language models (LLMs) to categorize, extract, and identify underlying problems from every incoming help desk ticket. With just a glance, you can get a comprehensive view of all issues in your organization.\\n\\nWe initially built EXI because we realized that natural language analytics can help business leaders make data-driven decisions that result in smarter, more efficient operations and, ultimately, better outcomes for the organization.\\n\\nAnd that’s why at Moveworks Live, we revealed our ambitious plan to further apply the power of LLMs in analyzing unstructured data across various departments, starting with HR and eventually expanding into customer support and more.\\n\\nThis development marks the beginning of a transformative journey that will utilize natural language analytics to streamline operations and enhance efficiency on a broader scale throughout the entire enterprise.\\n\\nIf you’re a current Moveworks customer, you can request a 14-day free trial of EXI here.\\n\\nFill in the gaps with AI-powered knowledge generation\\n\\nMoveworks Knowledge Writer is a game-changing tool designed to significantly reduce the time it takes to create, maintain, and update informative content for employees.\\n\\nThis powerful tool uses AI to generate content, incorporating your organization\\'s data and tailoring each piece for your unique environment.\\n\\nBy using industry article templates and writing recommendations, you’ll effortlessly follow the most up-to-date guidelines for crafting engaging FAQs, tutorials, guidelines, policies, troubleshooting articles, and more.\\n\\nRest assured, as Knowledge Writer provides the source of generated information, ensuring the quality and accuracy of your content while eliminating concerns about hallucinations.\\n\\nAnd we won’t leave you hanging! Our AI insights will ensure that you stay on top of your articles\\' performance and gain the valuable insights you need to continuously improve your knowledge base and address the needs of your employees.\\n\\nEnhance the user experience with voice support\\n\\nMoveworks Voice is reinventing the way voice recognition systems operate, departing from the limitations of traditional Interactive Voice Recognition (IVR) systems.\\n\\nWhile IVRs often struggle with aspects like ambient noise, speech variations, and industry-specific jargon, Moveworks Voice is designed to proficiently understand and navigate the intricacies of voice interactions, to assist in fluent and accurate responses.\\n\\nOne of the tool\\'s capabilities is to answer questions and take actions tailored to the unique needs of your organization\\'s environment.

The massive number of apps and workflows deployed by modern enterprises has made it increasingly difficult to work efficiently.\\n\\nToggling between fragmented systems has become the norm, with most employees spending a significant amount of time just learning to navigate the latest platform, not knowing how to execute even the most basic tasks or even which app has the information they need.\\n\\nHow do you solve this challenge at scale across the hundreds of workflows you've built and all the knowledge articles you've written? Creating custom use cases can be a real headache, demanding immense manual labor and technical know-how. It can take several months or even years to just launch one.\\n\\nMoveworks' new Creator Studio is set to change all of that.\\n\\nLaunching today, Creator Studio is a generative, no-code platform that connects employees to every system and application across the enterprise with a unified, natural language interface.\\n\\nWith Creator Studio, the people who know your business best — service owners, system owners, and enterprise architects across teams and departments — can create custom conversational AI use cases in minutes, all without the need for coding, scripting, or complex dialogue flows.\\n\\nAnd you’ll be able to deploy everywhere. Each new use case built with Creator Studio will be available in collaboration tools, including Microsoft Teams, Slack, Whatsapp, Facebook, and more. This also includes support for various modes of communication, like text, voice, and image, with on-the-fly translation in over 100 languages.\\n\\nStarting today, language will serve as a universal interface that enables employees to bypass the complexities of enterprise ecosystems, search for information, and take action across every application simply by asking. Companies like Coca-Cola Consolidated and Power Design are already leveraging Creator Studio to use language as the primary interface for all apps, systems, workflows, and automations.\\n\\nInterested in learning more? Schedule a demo! In the meantime, to give you an idea of what's possible, let me highlight the three key Creator Studio workspaces: Paths, Queries, and Events.\\n\\nPaths workspace: Generate any custom conversational AI use case in minutes\\n\\nPaths workspace is a powerful no-code tool that allows teams to create fully controllable, generative, and custom conversations about specific, frequently requested topics.\\n\\nTraditional conversational AI toolkits can be complex and difficult to work with, often requiring extensive technical knowledge and scripting expertise. But with Paths, teams can easily describe the use case they need, and the platform's advanced generative AI and natural language processing capabilities will take care of the rest.\\n\\nFigure 1: With Creator Studio Paths, you can generate customer conversational AI use cases with natural language.\\n\\nPaths makes it possible for anyone to use a system conversationally. Let’s look at expense management. Instead of finding the right app and figuring out the new user interface, employees to access their expense reports conversationally, saving time and effort for both themselves and their managers.\\n\\nOther use cases include:\\n\\nTransferring sales account ownership\\n\\nProvisioning a server\\n\\nSetting an out-of-office message\\n\\nFigure 2: Enable your employees to access their expenses with a simple question with Creator Studio.\\n\\nQueries workspace: Securely access data from any system\\n\\nIn today's fast-paced business world, data is king. But the sheer amount of information siloed away in countless systems and applications can make it difficult for employees to quickly access the insights they need. That's where Queries come in.\\n\\nWith Queries workspace, employees can access data from any system, app, or workflow across their organization in just a few clicks. Whether you need to check the status of a sales deal in your CRM or see the latest updates on a project in your project management tool, Queries has you covered. Say goodbye to juggling endless apps and systems and hello to fast, efficient access to the data you need to get your job done.\\n\\nFigure 3: With Creator Studio Queries, you can securely access data from any system.\\n\\nWith the ability to enable data queries across applications, Creator Studio can enhance efficiency and productivity for employees, including the Sales team. For example, by allowing the applicable employee to query Salesforce data, Creator Studio can surface essential account information, freeing up time for more impactful analyses and prospect conversations.\\n\\nOther use cases include:\\n\\nLooking up account leads\\n\\nSurfacing Purchase Requisitions (PR) and Purchase Orders (PO)\\n\\nRetrieving legal documents\\n\\nSearching for pending inbox messages\\n\\nLooking up app owners\\n\\nFigure 4: Creator Studio lets anyone query Salesforce data so your team can focus on more impactful analyses.\\n\\nEvents workspace: Send proactive, actionable recommendations\\n\\nKeeping on top of important events can be a real challenge, especially when you're juggling multiple tasks at once.\\n\\nWith Events workspace, you can integrate with any application to streamline notifications and send proactive, actionable recommendations to help you stay on top of things before they slip through the cracks. From timely reminders about employee anniversaries to suggestions for cleaning up your disk space, Events helps you prioritize your work and stay ahead of the game.\\n\\nFigure 5: With Creator Studio Events, you can send proactive, actionable recommendations.\\n\\nFrom a user-experience perspective, Creator Studio helps employees act quickly in the face of critical events. With its rapid incident escalation capabilities, your team can resolve issues quickly and with minimal disruption.\\n\\nOther use cases include:\\n\\nNotifying that contracts are ready\\n\\nReminding about upcoming interviews\\n\\nSending follow-up support ticket surveys\\n\\nSending laptop refresh reminders\\n\\nEnforce control attestation\\n\\nFigure 6: Creator Studio helps developers to rapidly escalate business critical incidents.\\n\\nCreator Studio: Not another rules-based chatbot\\n\\nThe field of conversational AI has been transformed in recent years by using large language models (LLMs) and generative AI. Leveraging these advancements, Creator Studio offers an enterprise-ready platform that is both highly effective and infinitely scalable.\\n\\nActing as a layer on top of your enterprise apps, Creator Studio allows users to communicate and take control of systems and applications using natural language. With seamless communication between each system and application, Moveworks can take action based on user needs, increasing efficiency and productivity.\\n\\nCompared to existing conversational AI toolkits, such as rules-based chatbots, Creator Studio is user-friendly and highly effective. Traditional solutions often require a great deal of technical expertise, precise coding of dialog flows, and are challenging to restructure.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Creator Studio removes the need for dialogue flows altogether and instead harnesses the power of generative AI and best-in-class LLMs, like GPT 3.5 and GPT-4 — grounded by the Moveworks enterprise graph to improve robustness and reduce hallucinations — to generate any custom conversational AI use case. It is an enterprise-ready platform that facilitates easy implementation.\\n\\nMoveworks' conversational AI foundation powers Creator Studio\\n\\nAt Moveworks, our dedication to pushing the boundaries of this technology is exemplified through our early access to the world's most advanced large language models (LLMs) on the market.\\n\\nWe've been leveraging the power of LLMs and Natural Language Understanding (NLU) for several years, and our latest innovation, Creator Studio, builds on this foundation of best-in-class LLMs, proprietary NLU, AI, and machine learning technology.\\n\\nOne of the unique features of Creator Studio is our use of multiple LLMs instead of just one. This approach is similar to having a toolbox with different tools, each suited for different tasks. Multiple LLMs with different specializations and abilities enhance their performance and better suit them for specific tasks. Using multiple LLMs provides a broader range of perspectives and knowledge, leading to more well-rounded and accurate outputs.\\n\\nWith LLMs and NLU, we've changed the way conversational AI is used by the enterprise. Creator Studio is merely the latest example of how. With Creator Studio, our customers can use our out-of-the-box solutions or build customized conversational AI solutions tailored to their specific needs. This is achieved through cutting-edge LLMs like OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 and generative AI, which connect disparate apps and workflows across enterprises and allows users to create custom conversational AI use cases in minutes, without the need for coding, scripting, or complex dialogue flows.\\n\\nWe're proud to be pioneers in using LLMs for conversational AI and look forward to continuing to push the boundaries of this technology.\\n\\nCreator Studio democratizes conversational AI for the enterprise\\n\\nCreator Studio marks a significant milestone in the evolution of conversational AI for the enterprise. Its powerful combination of large language models, natural language processing, and machine learning technologies empowers enterprises to create highly-effective, infinitely-scalable, and personalized conversational AI solutions in minutes without requiring extensive technical expertise.\\n\\nWith its user-friendly interface, Creator Studio radically simplifies the creation of customizable workflows, streamlining the design and deployment of conversational AI applications across different use cases and industries. By democratizing the power of conversational AI, Creator Studio is set to transform how enterprises interact with their customers and employees.\\n\\nTo experience the full potential of Creator Studio, interested parties can schedule a demo with the Moveworks team. Whether you're looking to optimize your IT service desk, HR support, or sales operations, Creator Studio can help you easily achieve your goals.\\n\\nJoin us at Moveworks Live to learn how conversational AI is transforming the enterprise.

This dedication was made abundantly clear at Microsoft\\'s annual developer conference, Build 2023, which showcased an array of announcements, reflecting the company\\'s unwavering commitment to investing in generative AI technology.\\n\\nToday, we’ll recap notable sessions and announcements, delving into exciting developments within Microsoft\\'s ecosystem. Join us as we explore how these innovations enable businesses to excel in an increasingly competitive landscape:\\n\\n\\u200b\\u200bIntegrating Bing with ChatGPT\\n\\nWindows Copilot\\n\\nInnovative plugins\\n\\nAzure AI Studio\\n\\nIntegrating Bing with ChatGPT\\n\\nThe tech landscape continues to experience intensified competition, with Microsoft\\'s Bing taking significant strides to optimize its capabilities. The recent Microsoft Build event showcased the integration of Bing with ChatGPT, a collaboration that promises vastly improved answer results by ensuring up-to-date information sourced directly from relevant web pages.\\n\\nMicrosoft also announced a range of exciting new features for Bing Chat, as well as support for plugins and an open preview that eliminates waitlists. Here\\'s a quick overview of just some upcoming features:\\n\\nChat history support\\n\\nExport and share functionality\\n\\nImproved summarization of longer documents and webpages\\n\\nBing Image Creator support for over 100 languages\\n\\nThese innovative developments within Bing Chat illustrate Microsoft\\'s commitment to providing users with a comprehensive and efficient search experience through cutting-edge advancements in technology.\\n\\nWindows Copilot\\n\\nMicrosoft aims to elevate user experience with the introduction of the Windows Copilot. This innovation transforms every user into a Windows power user by enabling them to engage in tasks such as launching focus sessions, switching to dark mode, and silencing notifications.\\n\\nWindows Copilot also offers interoperability with plugins, as demonstrated by using the Spotify plugin to play a focus playlist at Build. This cutting-edge AI tool is designed to improve efficiency across various applications by generating suggestions, automating tasks, and offering real-time assistance during meetings. It also adapts to new skills and tasks, adhering to Microsoft\\'s security, compliance, and privacy standards.\\n\\nThe Windows Copilot is under testing with a selected group of customers, and its widespread release will demonstrate Microsoft\\'s commitment to changing how users interact with technology and boosting productivity across industries.\\n\\nNew Microsoft plugins\\n\\nMicrosoft has unveiled an innovative collection of plugins designed to work seamlessly with both Windows Copilot and Microsoft 365 Copilot. With 50 plugins ready for launch, including Moveworks, and even more in development, Microsoft aims to simplify the process of creating additional plugins using low-code techniques.\\n\\nBuild featured an example with an employee working on a legal document and using the Microsoft 365 Copilot. By calling on a Thomson Reuters plugin, the integration enabled effortless understanding of California law and facilitated content insertion directly into the Word document. As we move forward, it\\'s essential to consider plugins in the same light as app marketplaces, as they are fast becoming a crucial part of the industry landscape.\\n\\nDespite other companies undoubtedly launching their own plugins, it’s vital to understand that plugins are designed to fulfill specific tasks and do not encompass an entire application. Instead, they generally cater to their unique use case and aren\\'t designed to work collectively or take action across numerous enterprise systems.\\n\\nAzure AI Studio\\n\\nMicrosoft\\'s Build event unveiled the Azure AI Studio, a comprehensive tool for developing the next generation of AI models. With Azure AI Studio, developers can create AI apps and copilots by using data from Azure or importing it.\\n\\nThe platform aims to offer a full-cycle tool for building, customizing, and deploying conversational experiences. Developers now have access to models from Hugging Face and other open-source platforms — an advance from previously being limited to OpenAI models.\\n\\nThough Azure AI Studio might entice companies willing to build their use cases and copilots, it’s crucial to remember that building AI copilots and use cases is not an easy task. Even developing a single use case demands technical expertise, time, maintenance, and resources. And building multiple use cases, chaining them together, creating a reasoning engine, fine-tuning, securing, and integrating them to achieve more specialized output is an extremely complex and challenging process. Most companies will struggle to build and maintain a solution with the value and efficiency that a more enterprise-focused AI provides out of the box.\\n\\nMicrosoft\\xa0and\\xa0Moveworks are all in on AI\\n\\nMicrosoft Build 2023 delivered a rich array of ground-breaking announcements, emphasizing the tech giant\\'s commitment to innovation in AI, user experience, and plugin advancements within their ecosystem.\\n\\nThese developments have the potential to significantly impact businesses globally as we continue to rely on technology to excel in an increasingly competitive landscape. We realize that these offerings may present new opportunities, and Moveworks remains focused on delivering unparalleled value to its users by addressing the unique needs enterprises continue to face.\\n\\nNow and in the future, we can expect Microsoft\\'s continuous innovations to redefine the way we interact with technology and elevate productivity across various industries.\\n\\nRequest a demo\\xa0to see how your business can use conversational AI.\\n\\nnews\\n\\nMore blog posts\\n\\nHow to unlock continual service improvement with AIOps\\n      \\n        \\n          Discover how AIOps transforms IT operations from reactive to proactive.

Almost overnight, toolkit chatbots seem as obsolete as dial-up internet and floppy disks.\\n\\nThat said — ChatGPT and, by extension, large language models (LLMs) are not without their limitations. To truly leverage the full potential of the technology, we need to understand what they do well — and perhaps more importantly, what their limitations are.\\n\\nMy belief, and the one that we’re betting on at Moveworks, is that ChatGPT has kicked off an innovation race that is going to accelerate technological developments faster than most people are anticipating. The model underpinning ChatGPT, GPT-3.5, along with its successor, GPT-4, and other generative AI models are about to power a wave of innovation in conversational AI.\\n\\nMy team and I at Moveworks have been experimenting with generative AI for a while now and we\\'re excited about the impact these models can have on our customers over the coming months.\\n\\nToday, I’m just going to give you a high-level view. You’ll leave understanding why ChatGPT is a game-changer in the world of conversational AI. And you’ll leave understanding why mitigating the potential downsides of large language models isn’t exactly a trivial exercise.\\n\\nChatGPT has changed the game\\n\\nGiven my decades-long experience working on search and conversational AI engines, I have seen one breakthrough after another. Still, seeing and experiencing the power of large language models via ChatGPT is nothing short of awe-inspiring.\\n\\nTen years ago, it took a team of highly talented researchers and engineers working hundreds, if not thousands, of hours building and training layers of machine learning algorithms — ASR, Translation, Spell Correction, Entity Recognition, Entity Resolution, Intent Classification, Slot Filling, Search, Question Answering, Dialog Policy, and more — to make sense of natural conversation. Each layer is the result of hours of masterfully designed experiments. It was incredibly complex work.\\n\\nLet me try to put this in perspective. For generations, to create a high-quality watch you needed a combination of expert craftsmanship, specialized machinery, high-quality materials, and attention to detail. The design and engineering of the watch must be carefully planned, the various components of the watch must be precision-manufactured, and finally, the watch must be carefully assembled and tested to ensure that it is keeping accurate time.\\n\\nJust as the gears in a watch must be precisely manufactured, each with its own unique shape and size, machine learning algorithms must be carefully designed and implemented to perform specific tasks. But large language models, like the GPT-3 model powering ChatGPT, are shifting that paradigm. Instead of having a team of people working to create layers of algorithms that link together, one singular model is doing what many, many different systems had to do before. In essence, having a conversation with ChatGPT is like 3D printing a Swiss watch. Suddenly — everyone has the knowledge and reasoning power of LLMs at their fingertips.\\n\\nWe have been on this path for a few years following the release of OpenAI’s GPT-2, GPT-3, and Codex, as well as other LLMs. But there hasn’t been one that can generate responses as polished as ChatGPT until now. It took LLMs into the mainstream, putting their next-level sophistication in a package that’s accessible to everyone. Some clear examples for why I believe it\\'s remarkable include how it:\\n\\nIncorporates prompts to complete different tasks\\n\\nUnderstands the underlying intent to a high accuracy, completely out of the box\\n\\nDebugs code\\n\\nDemonstrates complex reasoning\\n\\nUses a single model for multiple sophisticated tasks\\n\\nHolds long contextual multi-turn dialogues with its long context window length\\n\\nGenerates coherent language that is personable and natural\\n\\nBut, large language models are not without their limits.\\n\\nLLMs have brought about impressive advances in AI and have the potential to revolutionize a wide range of industries. However, understanding their nuances is crucial in using them in real-world applications. Let me explain:\\n\\n1. LLMs hallucinate.\\n\\nChatGPT can deliver some mind-blowingly accurate responses to questions. It can understand long, complex requests and then generate succinctly summarized responses that perfectly address the question. That is the real magic of ChatGPT. And it performs this feat a large majority of the time.\\n\\nThe challenge is that the remaining percent of the time the responses are not just \"a little off\", they can be factually inaccurate and in some cases completely made up. This is an interesting dilemma, not just for ChatGPT but for LLMs in general. In fact, there’s a term for when LLMs sometimes generate factually incorrect statements: hallucination.\\n\\nYou could give ChatGPT one hundred percent of the context needed to give you the right answer, and it will still surface the wrong answer. In the example below, I’ve told the bot that 1-800-APLCARE is a real support line, and it responds “1-800-APLCARE is not a real Apple support line\" and then contradicts itself in the following sentence stating, yes, \"the correct number to call for Apple support is 1-800-275-2273 (1-800-APL-CARE).\"\\n\\nQuoting from different sources can’t solve the problem either since the model often takes sentences out of context and reassembles them into a paragraph to create an incorrect answer. In the instance below, the pricing of g4dn.xlarge is grafted to g4dn.4xlarge.\\n\\nThe subtlety of these inaccuracies can appear innocent but have much broader implications when dealing with more sensitive subjects. To the untrained eye, incorrect statements could very well seem true. In its research, OpenAI acknowledges this challenge, stating that hallucination poses a very real threat when LLMs are used for real-world applications — like responding to employee questions in a business setting or providing automated patient support in a healthcare setting.\\n\\nAdding to the challenge, no one can predict when it will hallucinate. This nuance is why it’s important to carefully consider which types of use cases ChatGPT, and LLMs in general, are currently suited to and which might require more thought.\\n\\nLLMs are genuinely amazing tools. But their truthfulness needs improvement to be used widely in the enterprise. And if these models generate answers that are not faithful to the input data in business-critical situations, the results could be catastrophic — legally, financially, and otherwise. Wasted time and resources, misguided troubleshooting, data loss, and even equipment damage could occur.\\n\\nThat’s why it is so important to layer models, processes, and guardrails that are capable of refining the inputs and controlling for the outputs on top of LMMs. Only then can you guarantee the truthfulness of their results. That is why most current out-of-the-box applications of LLMs, like copy generation and co-pilot, require human oversight. They can’t be trusted to provide fully automated support yet.\\n\\n2. LLMs lack controllability.\\n\\nLLMs know a lot, and they can do a lot. One of the most amazing things about ChatGPT is that you don\\'t need to be a machine learning expert to get the LLM that it is built on top of to do magical things. Anyone can type in a prompt and get an immediate response.\\n\\nThis ability is a result of the fact that LLMs are general models designed to perform a wide range of tasks and adapt to new environments — not a narrow set of tasks. As such, they are the result of fusing layers and layers of algorithms, and that’s where it gets complex.\\xa0 While this approach of fusing layers of models together dramatically shortens the time required to build and train complex systems, it offers limited ability to control the model\\'s responses.\\n\\nControllability refers to the ability of a system to be directed or brought to a specific state using a specific input. Just like a car on a straight road, a LLM has a specific state, which in this case is the internal representation of the text it generates. The inputs to the model are the text prompts given to it and the corresponding outputs are the text it generates.\\n\\nJust as the car driver can apply the accelerator and the brake to change the car\\'s position and velocity, the user can provide different prompts to the language model to generate different outputs. However, just as a car driver cannot control every aspect of the car\\'s movement, such as traffic or the road conditions, users of a LLM also have limited control over the output. The model is trained on a large dataset and is able to generate a wide variety of responses, but the specific outcome is not always predictable.\\n\\nAdding to that challenge, programming an LLM is currently limited to writing prompts. But, as visualized by the diagram above, written prompts are limited. At this time, prompt length can’t exceed 2048 tokens. While that number could extend, it doesn’t address the core challenge of only being able to communicate with LLMs via text-based prompts of limited size.\\n\\nOn the contrary, the communication bandwidth between the traditional layered intelligent system and the enterprise environment is much higher than LLMs can provide and offer more opportunities for us to control, fine-tune and override the behaviors.\\n\\nThat’s why I predict there will be a more programmable and higher bandwidth interface opening up for LLMs. For example, LLMs might allow people to input embeddings instead of prompts.\\n\\nFor an intelligent system to thrive in a business setting, it needs to live and breathe the enterprise environment that it is designed to serve. To return to my car analogy, businesses need to be in the driver’s seat so that they can weather their own unique traffic. Controllability is necessary and LLMs must form part of a larger AI architecture that adds control and fine-tuning, offers further training and evaluation processes, and combines alternative machine learning approaches. That’s when things will get interesting.\\n\\n3. LLMs have associative memory that gets stale.\\n\\nTo be able to deliver such an amazing experience, LLMs are trained on vast amounts of data. GPT-3, for example, is trained on a whopping 45 terabytes of text data from different datasets. However, training data are typically drawn from a specific time period and may not accurately reflect the current state of the world or the latest developments.\\n\\nTo go deeper — LLMs learn both reasoning capabilities and associative memory of the knowledge they are trained on. Reasoning and memory are inseparable and are both required to perform a given task. The associated memory is stuck in the time period in which it was trained, and there’s no easy overriding mechanism to update it except for spending millions of dollars to retrain them.\\n\\nFor example, if an LLM was trained on data from 2020, like GPT3.5, the model ChatGPT is built on top of, and was asked about a current event that occurred in 2022, it wouldn’t be able to generate an accurate or relevant response. For example, the James Webb Space Telescope was launched in 2021, revealing the universe in a way never before seen by the world. If you were to ask ChatGPT about this telescope’s discoveries today, the bot would give an irrelevant answer, stating: “...it hasn’t had time to make any scientific discoveries yet.” Which we could say is categorically old news.\\n\\nEven though people are attempting to put a search engine underneath it to bring in fresh data, it isn’t easy to instruct the LLM to override parts of the model’s knowledge while retaining the other in order to generate an up-to-date answer. There is no guarantee that an LLM won’t give out stale information even though the search engine it is paired with has up-to-date information. This poses a novel and unique challenge, especially with respect to a business setting, where most of the information is private and changes in real-time.\\n\\nIs ChatGPT worth the buzz? Absolutely.\\n\\nChatGPT is a black swan event resulting from years of explosive progress in the field of AI. It has opened the eyes of machine learning veterans like myself to what is possible.\\n\\nHowever, it’s essential to recognize that ChatGPT and large language models require a lot of sophistication and understanding of their nuances in order to successfully apply them in business-critical, domain-specific, or real-time applications. Make no mistake, the potential for ChatGPT to drive innovation and drive businesses forward makes it an essential technology for any AI company worth its salt. If you\\'re not exploring and investing in it now, you’re going to be left behind.\\n\\nAt Moveworks, we’ve built our company on the idea that communication between people and machines should be seamless, and ChatGPT is a jaw-dropping step forward. This development will only fuel our ambition to build simply magical conversation experiences for our customers. Our accumulated domain- and task-specific data, our unique insight into our customers’ needs, and our ever-maturing MLOps system are exactly what is needed to leverage this new technology.\\n\\nWe’re planning to embrace the GPT family, and other generative AI models to bring the magical ChatGPT-style experiences to the enterprise — with the required level of finesse and predictability that businesses demand.\\n\\nContact\\xa0Moveworks to learn what conversational AI can do for you and your business.\\n\\nnews\\n\\ntechnology\\n\\nMore blog posts\\n\\nHow to unlock continual service improvement with AIOps\\n      \\n        \\n          Discover how AIOps transforms IT operations from reactive to proactive.

I think we can safely add OpenAI’s ChatGPT to that list.\\n\\nWhat puts ChatGPT on the same level as these other industry-defining innovations? There are massive announcements every year in the tech world. Engineers everywhere are constantly working to build the next big disruptive thing. What makes ChatGPT different?\\n\\nChatGPT is shaking up businesses everywhere.\\n\\nLet’s ask another question: What separates a game-changing tech from the status quo?\\n\\nTo answer, we’ll revisit a classic: The Innovator's Dilemma. In this book, author Clayton M. Christensen states that most new technologies are sustaining technologies that improve the performance of established products in ways mainstream customers traditionally value.\\n\\nHowever, some technologies can be disruptive, offering a new value proposition. And while disruptive technologies may initially underperform established products in mainstream markets, they have other features that appeal to fringe customers, such as being cheaper, simpler, smaller, or more convenient.\\n\\nTo offer an example: the smartphone market. Apple originally disrupted this market by releasing the iPhone, a tool that introduced the touch screen, among other innovations — essentially launching the mobile-first era.\\n\\nBut, the smartphone of today has become a sustaining technology. Every year, cell phone manufacturers, including Samsung, Huawei, and Apple, release updated products to meet consumer demand. While there have been other innovations, such as folding screens, these haven’t transformed the market like the first iPhone did.\\n\\nIn a word: disruptive tech is practical. How a technology can be used is massively important to its success. It doesn’t matter how amazing your algorithm is if it isn’t useful or user-friendly.\\n\\nTo offer a second example, Google’s search engine revolutionized how we access and find information online. But this tool isn’t just helpful for someone trying to figure out whether or not Netflix streams their favorite TV show; it opened up a whole new world, playing a role in shaping both the online marketplace and the offline marketplaces. By prioritizing certain types of content and websites in the search results, the algorithm has influenced consumer behavior and the success — or failure — of businesses worldwide.\\n\\nSo, again: How does ChatGPT fit in? Its creator OpenAI took something previously mostly found in technical research papers, large language models (LLMs), and turned it into an accessible technology. Giving people everywhere a way to experience the power of LLMs via a simple, conversational interface revealed what’s possible to the masses. There’s no going back. Now, every product that claims to be conversational AI must offer a similarly magical experience or fall into obscurity.\\n\\nUnderstanding the new AI stack\\n\\nI doubt generative AI will stop at helping people write emails. Much like Google revolutionized the world with its search engine and Apple put a smartphone in everyone’s pocket — ChatGPT will transform how people do business.\\n\\nThat said — deploying GPT-class models in production is no simple task. It requires an advanced Machine Learning Ops platform, a team of human annotators to generate training data, and skilled engineers to optimize performance. Without prior experience using LLMs, it can take years to build the necessary infrastructure. However, companies with a history of using LLMs are in a good position to quickly adopt the capabilities of this tech in their products.\\n\\nSuppose you’re someone who wants to incorporate conversational AI into your operations. The challenge for you is to figure out which conversational AI businesses are just hype and which are the real deal.\\n\\nAs more and more sales pitches from generative AI companies start filling your inbox, you need a surefire way to see through the marketing jargon and differentiate between the companies with the talent and experience to leverage this technology — and those that do not.\\n\\nWe’ll start with some basics: the conversational AI landscape can be divided into three layers: foundation, middle, and application.\\n\\nFigure 1: When you’re investing in a new tool, remember: What’s hard and what’s expensive are ultimately the differentiators. A company that lies at the intersection of the foundation, middle, and application layers will be able to differentiate itself from the competition.\\n\\n1. The foundation layer: The base of the AI stack\\n\\nChatGPT is the latest in a long line of genuinely game-changing generative AI technologies. As good as it is, though, ChatGPT isn’t a silver bullet. It does a lot of things well — astoundingly well, even. It can serve information in tight sentences rather than long lists of blue links. It can explain concepts in ways that people can understand. And it can brainstorm business plans, term paper topics, business strategies, birthday gift suggestions, and vacation plans.\\n\\nIt has such a wide breadth of knowledge because it is based on a foundation AI model; specifically, an LLM called GPT-3.5. Foundation AI models make up the base of the AI stack, trained enough to offer a perspective on a wide range of topics. Products like GPT-3 for text, DALL-E-2 for images, or Whisper for voice are examples of how foundation models can be applied to deal with broad categories of outputs: text, images, videos, speech, and games.\\n\\nBut — there are a couple of significant challenges when using foundation models.\\n\\nFor one, foundation models, like GPT-3, are monoliths. Like every model, the only way to change the output is to change the input. Foundation models are frozen in time. The particular capabilities of a generative AI system depend on how it’s trained and the types of information it is given.\\n\\nWhile you may have heard the term “prompt engineering” to describe the work people do to adjust and control model outputs of these models by inputting specific terms and structures, ultimately, their knowledge is tied to the original training data. A foundation model can’t look up dynamic data or any real-time information to tell you the current share price of Microsoft stock, for example. And they can’t create new ideas from scratch.\\n\\nPerhaps more importantly, many of the big tech players have their own foundation models based on the massive amount of data they can access. Microsoft was smart to partner with OpenAI early, and they will capitalize on this investment fast. Though they aren’t leading the wave, Google’s PaLM is significantly bigger than OpenAI’s GPT-3, unlocking even more capabilities. These big cloud providers will fight to have some offerings in this space. And the smaller, newer companies don’t stand a chance.\\n\\n2. The middle layer: Models powered by specialized data\\n\\nWhile the foundation layer offers a wide breadth of understanding, it’s not enough for businesses requiring 99.9% accuracy. By definition, foundation models offer general information and are fundamentally unfinished, requiring substantial building and productizing to be turned into something useful for more nuanced work. And that’s where the middle layer — and later, the application layer — come into play.\\n\\nProducts that live in the middle layer build smaller models capable of taking on more precise jobs. Trained on highly detailed — and typically proprietary — data, these models can write a knowledge base article pulling on details from your IT ecosystem. Or they can re-create a writer’s style and word choice. Or they could even edit stock photos to fit your exact brand specifications.\\n\\nOften developed for a particular application, industry, vertical, or use case, these more specific models outperform foundation models in their particular wheelhouses.\\n\\nHere’s where — to me — things start to get interesting. Companies can differentiate themselves by taking a foundation AI model and fine-tuning it to the needs of a particular business or industry. This is particularly powerful in fields where data is highly sensitive and specific domain knowledge is required to make accurate predictions, like finance, healthcare, energy, and manufacturing.\\n\\nTo offer an analogy: If Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and other tech giants have their own massive and well-equipped kitchens, you won’t be able to compete by just having a recipe book. But, if you have access to a wide variety of unique and high-quality ingredients and use them to create specialized dishes that complement the menu of the big players while also incorporating human expertise and feedback — that's where the real culinary success lies. The recipe may be necessary, but the ingredients are key.\\n\\nThe same goes for generative AI. Ultimately it’s the data that matters. Models are children of the data they’re trained on. Companies can differentiate from the competition by incorporating the specialized data they can access. This approach results in more nuanced results and a more defensible product that’s not just a flash in the pan.\\n\\n3. The application layer: A conversational user interface\\n\\nThe application layer is the last step that brings all these layers of models together. I’m referring to the interface where humans and machines collaborate, such as the workflow tools that make the AI models accessible in a way that enables business customers or consumer entertainment.\\n\\nThe application layer is crucial, especially in a post-ChatGPT world. Everyone is now expecting that magical conversational experience where anyone can write a prompt and get an answer.\\n\\nThe thing is that your product can’t just be an interface. Merely making API calls to other core foundation models isn’t enough to survive in such a competitive field. It may be easy to build these application layers, but they will struggle with retention and differentiation.\\n\\nI've already run through at least ten different content generation free trials in the past few weeks alone, but I’m not intending to renew them. It’s clear from the steady stream of marketing emails that pressure for this type of company is already mounting. They’re now offering discounted, unlimited plans, and we’re barely seven weeks out from ChatGPT’s launch.\\n\\nThere are, inevitably, going to be winners in this approach, but there are going to be more losers. Think about website-building platforms. You could learn some HTML and CSS to build a website or just use Squarespace. And for every Squarespace, a hundred other web-builders didn't make it.\\n\\nIf a company only provides workflow tools on top of widely available technologies, it may struggle to compete with larger companies with their own versions of these tools. Is there a world where Google doesn’t release its version of ChatGPT on Google Docs? Or where Microsoft doesn’t leverage GPT-3 in its Office Suite? I don’t think so. The foundation layer is available for everyone, so it won’t be a differentiator.\\n\\nCompanies that can bring unique datasets, train solutions, and offer precise answers at the application and operating system layers are more likely to be successful and highly valued for their solutions. And then, the interface becomes invaluable. ChatGPT has proven the versatility of conversation, and now users have high expectations.\\n\\nTo be genuinely competitive, products can’t just be a thin veneer on top of existing technologies. The companies that can bring a unique dataset and find a way to productize are the ones that will really make it big time.\\n\\nChatGPT made the world pay attention to generative AI. Now, you have a rubric to see through the hype.\\n\\nChatGPT has raised the bar for conversational AI, but it’s ultimately a base capability universally available to every business in the world. If you want to write a compelling outreach email, ChatGPT and the many, many competing applications on the market are going to be extremely helpful, but if you want to, for example, run a cost-efficient support organization, you’re going to need something else with more nuanced capabilities.\\n\\nThis is to say that when you’re investing in a new tool, remember: What’s hard and what’s expensive are ultimately the differentiators. A product without a unique value proposition won’t survive an extremely competitive market. If a vendor is only offering an application layer on top of a foundation model — they aren’t going to make it.\\n\\nThat’s why you must be thoughtful about what use cases you’re trying to solve and what specialized data your prospective vendor can access. Because if you invest in the wrong direction, you will end up with a solution as obsolete as the Blackberry or Kodak.\\n\\nIn the near future, the next step in LLMs — GPT-4 — will be announced, and it is almost guaranteed to blow everyone’s minds again because ChatGPT made the world pay attention. This tool marked the beginning of what will become conversational AI's true potential in the enterprise. Billions of dollars are being scrambled to deploy it or similar technology into many products.

But at Forrester’s Technology & Innovation Forum, I was reminded yet again of the importance of focusing on what’s practical.\\n\\nAI is no longer just a series of conceptual, pie-in-the-sky prototypes, ideas, and far-fetched science experiments. It’s now a core driver for companies who want to become a “future fit” organization — one that’s adaptive, creative, and resilient. In fact, millions of business leaders use AI every day to drive efficiency across their organizations, with individual use cases yielding millions in top- and bottom-line impact.\\n\\nAfter two days of rubbing elbows with leading industry analysts, the verdict is clear: AI is no longer a nice-to-have — it’s a necessity for your business success. It’s here to stay, and how it’s implemented will separate leaders from laggards. Further, a repeatable framework is needed to help inform AI investment decisions and measure their results. With these three things in mind, you can make AI practical. Let’s dive a bit deeper:\\n\\n1. AI is table stakes\\n\\nUnsurprisingly, AI was a hot topic at this event. Numerous sessions led by organizations such as Qualcomm and CognitiveScale touched on the value of AI, and how they’ve leveraged its capabilities to scale their operations and enable flexible work.\\n\\nWhat’s notable is that many organizations today are using AI not just in innovation labs adjacent to their core business, but in their daily operations. Looking forward, Forrester estimates that nearly 100% of all enterprises will use AI by 2025. That’s right, less than three years from now, using AI will be business as usual for millions of employees across the world. That’s an incredibly eye-opening projection — AI isn’t a nice-to-have any more, it’s instrumental to business competition.\\n\\n2. A successful AI deployment starts with choosing the right use cases\\n\\nOf course I’m biased, but I found Pinterest’s Derrick Diaz’s presentation about his experience deploying Moveworks’ conversational AI platform particularly enlightening. Acknowledging that AI is a growing space, he talked about why he partnered with Moveworks to drive his digital transformation initiatives.\\n\\nFor Derrick, it was of the utmost importance to find the right applications for AI. And I’m sure many business leaders can relate to this pressure since 85% of AI and machine learning projects fail to deliver, and only 53% of projects make it from prototype to production. With as many AI use cases as there are business processes, choosing the wrong approach and application will tie up valuable resources, waste time, and ultimately lose money for your organization.\\n\\nThat’s why Derrick was hyper-focused on the limits of what AI can and should do on its own. While AI is great for automation and handling repetitive work, there are plenty of situations where a human touch is still needed. The key is knowing the difference. My learning? Invest in AI that unlocks time for employees so they can focus on the most valuable, meaningful, and creative work. AI can — and at Pinterest, does — take care of the rest.\\n\\nFigure 1: The Moveworks team at Forrester's Technology & Innovation Forum\\n\\n3. AI’s value starts and ends with its impact\\n\\nThere’s a general lack of understanding and consistency in evaluating both an AI tool's potential value before deployment and measuring its realized value after deployment. This makes it challenging when you want to calculate returns on investments on the front end (hoping and praying they deliver value), and when you want to measure results (over- or under-valuing impact) on the back end.\\n\\nTo overcome these obstacles, you need a repeatable framework that reliably estimates value opportunity and measures value realized. I’ll write about this more in upcoming blog posts, but at a high level, this framework starts with business and IT stakeholder alignment on the outcomes you seek to achieve and an understanding of how to measure strategic and operational KPIs over time.\\n\\nMoveworks’ Founder and VP of Product, Varun Singh, discussed this very topic in a panel at the Forrester event. It’s important to understand which business investments are delivering positive results, especially in the economic climate we’re experiencing today. At Moveworks, we partner with our customers to align on their desired business outcomes and on KPIs that will help to inform their investment decisions and assess performance in the long run.\\n\\nWith 65% of firms increasing their emerging tech spend in the upcoming year, many business leaders are keen to take advantage of the opportunities created through technologies like AI. Whether they plan to use it to enhance the ROI of existing technology investments or drive greater employee productivity, having a clear understanding of the business outcomes AI will drive is paramount. Ask yourself: How will this technology make me more efficient, more creative, more collaborative, more informed, or more excited to come to work every day?\\n\\nPractical AI will unlock the future of work\\n\\nAI is a fundamental building block to becoming a future fit organization — use it. Hone your focus and prioritize AI use cases that will deliver the greatest business results — limit the science experiments. Leverage a repeatable framework that aligns key stakeholders on the business outcomes (and KPIs) you seek to achieve — make informed investment decisions. Doing these three things will help you unlock practical AI, leading your company into a new era.\\n\\nThe most innovative companies use practical AI to power their employee experience.\\n\\nRead our case studies to learn more.\\n\\nbest practices\\n\\nnews\\n\\ntechnology\\n\\nemployee experience\\n\\nMore blog posts\\n\\nHow to unlock continual service improvement with AIOps\\n      \\n        \\n          Discover how AIOps transforms IT operations from reactive to proactive.

This problem is made even more frustrating given that outside of work, getting answers is as easy as Google.\\n\\nWhy do we go to Google? First of all, it understands our questions, even when they aren’t perfectly polished or particularly well framed. It also answers every question. Google’s not limited to science, literature, or business strategy. And finally, it’s smart enough to surface the most relevant results. Billions of people use Google daily because it really is one place for everything.\\n\\nSo why doesn’t getting an answer at work feel the same way? Well — internal support systems don’t understand us, resources are siloed, and responses aren’t personalized.\\n\\nFigure 1: Bringing consumer search capabilities to the business world is a game-changer.\\n\\nWe last talked about this problem of enterprise search in 2019. Since then, we've developed layer upon layer of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models to take in any question, understand it, and offer a precise, actionable answer.\\n\\nWorking with customers like DocuSign, Slack, and Broadcom, we’ve come to realize that the challenge of getting help at work extends far beyond IT. Seeing firsthand the responsibilities of other support teams — HR, Finance, Facilities — we’ve spent years building a comprehensive employee experience platform powered by AI.\\n\\nFigure 2: Moveworks is the go-to expert for every employee question.\\n\\nThe blog explores the technology behind building an effortless employee support experience:\\n\\nUnderstanding every employee question\\n\\nTransforming complex resources into digestible snippets\\n\\nMatching questions to specific answers\\n\\nUnderstanding every employee issue\\n\\nLet’s start at the beginning: understanding what people need. A consumer search engine like Google works so well because its engineers have spent years building rich algorithms to learn how people communicate. Few companies have the resources to make something this powerful themselves.\\n\\nSo, support teams resort to conventional approaches, like manually keyword tagging knowledge base articles or other brittle techniques that lack the intelligence needed to automatically answer the thousands of questions employees ask.\\n\\nAt Moveworks, we realized that to jump this first hurdle we would need to break down the language people use to ask for help at work. Employees explain symptoms: My computer is running hot. I can’t find the certification training. When can I find my tax withholdings? These are standard, everyday issues that flood service desks. It’s easy, but time-consuming, for a support agent to answer these questions, and the ambiguity of the language makes it difficult for a computer to step in.\\n\\nMoveworks Language Core™\\n\\nUnderstanding this type of enterprise language is at the core of what we do at Moveworks. We’ve built Language Core™ — an AI-powered system that treats every question as complex words and phrases with context and intent, not just as clusters of keywords. Our system is designed to figure out what people need, no matter how their question is spelled or worded.\\n\\nOne of the primary challenges in understanding language is that every company has its own internal jargon, from conference rooms to WiFi names to job titles. We take in all these names, attaching them to a frame of reference. Using\\xa0Collective Learning techniques that we’ve pioneered — we can see what employee requests have in common to understand more specific enterprise language.\\n\\nFigure 3: Collective Learning illuminates patterns across different lines of business, companies, and industries.\\n\\nNow we've made the move to answering the full diversity of questions that employees have at work. To support all these different support teams, we've built what we call domain classification models to help our bot understand the difference between issues in IT, Finance, HR, and Facilities.\\n\\nThese models deeply break down employee language, taking in signals and context to decide how to best resolve issues. What’s particularly remarkable is that our bot can correctly categorize questions with 95% accuracy.\\n\\nOnce our bot understands the issue, what the employee needs, and the applicable domain — it has to be able to find the right answer. And this also requires a sophisticated approach.\\n\\nPrecisely answering questions across the enterprise\\n\\nFor each employee service department — IT, HR, Finance, Legal, Facilities — answers live deep inside different resources and systems. And usually, within these knowledge bases, the answer appears only once, a paragraph, a sentence, or even a phrase. The last time we wrote about enterprise search, we said that finding the best answer is like “trying to find the only needle in a haystack.” But now that we cover all these different departments — there are dozens of haystacks, but still only one needle.\\n\\nWhen a subject-matter expert writes an article, they are trying to document everything. But this kind of detail can be difficult for employees to find, read, and understand. Knowledge articles can be thirty pages of potential WiFi issues, including everything from VPN complications to troubleshooting routers. And when it comes to HR — healthcare benefits articles can be hundreds of pages of text, featuring information from a dozen different countries.\\n\\nThe key is figuring a way to get the right information in the right hands. And we’ve done this with Enterprise Cache™ — a system that indexes available resources, so every question is answered with a single, precise snippet of information.\\n\\nMoveworks Enterprise Cache™\\n\\nEnterprise Cache™ solves two problems. First, the problem of hard-to-find information. And second, the problem of information accessibility.\\n\\nTo tackle this first problem — our solution ingests all the resources your employee service departments have painstakingly created, deconstructing them into chat-optimized pieces of information. Instead of a complete article, an employee gets a personalized snippet. Instead of a form, an employee only needs to fill out relevant fields. And instead of a full floor plan, they receive exact directions on where they need to go.\\n\\nFigure 4: Moveworks personalizes the support experience by giving employees exactly the resource they need, whether that is a single sentence from a knowledge article or a conversationalized form.\\n\\nThe second problem is making it easy for people to use this now deconstructed information. That's where document typing comes in. We use machine learning models to classify all these pieces as factoids, how-tos, troubleshooting steps, and hardware or software forms by adding in metadata. By sorting information in this way, employees get only relevant information that's been simplified and distilled to bulleted instructions.\\n\\nAs for support teams — they can keep using their tools and updating resources on their schedule. The bot will continue to crawl available systems for possible answers, automatically incorporating new or updated content.\\n\\nMatching questions with answers\\n\\nSifting through dozens of disconnected back-end systems to craft a personalized answer is a massive, manual effort for employee service teams. The same question doesn’t always have the same answer. Factors like an employee’s location, department, seniority, and security permissions all determine what she needs to know.\\n\\nWith Semantic Match™, we connect all of these dots automatically to get employees exactly the right resources.\\n\\nMoveworks Semantic Match™\\n\\nUnlike other enterprise search systems, our solution intelligently surfaces information by considering context. With this 360-degree view of your organization, our relevance and location models retrieve the most accurate answer.\\n\\nSemantic Match™ takes every piece of this disparate data into account, from the words and phrases employees use to the resources available to the person asking. For example, if an employee asks for an update on health care benefits — the bot can offer information based on the user’s location. So employees get a quick and straightforward answer in seconds that is personalized to their specific circumstances.\\n\\nFigure 5: Keeping track of an employee’s location, department, and other information, a chatbot can surface information relevant to a specific employee.\\n\\nAll enterprise answers in one place\\n\\nGoogle's accomplished an incredible feat with consumer search. It’s more than a household name — it’s a verb.

But with thousands of issues to solve and employees working all over the world, supporting a growing workforce has never been a greater challenge. That’s why support teams are increasingly turning to virtual agents to get their people the help they need — anytime and anywhere.\\n\\nYet these virtual agents present a new challenge: knowing what good looks like. There’s simply no industry standard for tracking their progress or benchmarking their performance. And with many solutions on the market that all quantify performance in different ways, it’s hard to determine which metrics actually matter.\\n\\nAfter working with more than 100 of the world's largest companies, we found that their leaders measure the impact of their virtual agent using these seven core metrics:\\n\\nResolution rate: the percentage of all service desk issues the virtual agent solves autonomously\\n\\nTime to value (TTV): the amount of time it takes to get results from the virtual agent\\n\\nTime to resolution (TTR): the amount of time it takes the virtual agent to solve employee issues\\n\\nResource utilization: the percentage of issues solved by existing knowledge base articles and forms\\n\\nBot preference: the percentage of employees who go to the virtual agent first when they need support\\n\\nIssue prevention: the percentage of issues proactively prevented by the virtual agent\\n\\nSatisfaction score (CSAT): the percentage of employees satisfied with the virtual agent’s support\\n\\nResolution rate\\n\\nThe primary goal for most virtual agents is to solve as many support issues as possible, automatically, with no intervention from a support team.\\n\\nTracking the resolution rate offers a high-level view of how much work your virtual agent is responsible for accomplishing on your behalf. The most important thing about calculating the resolution rate is deciding what should be in the numerator and the denominator.\\n\\nSo how should you decide? One method is to divide the number of issues that your virtual agent solves end-to-end by the number of issues that employees directly submit to it. But while this method provides a sense of the virtual agent's quality, it fails to capture the impact it's making with respect to all support issues — including those submitted through other channels like email.\\n\\nTo get a broader picture of your virtual agent's success, you could use\\xa0every employee-submitted support issue as the denominator for resolution rate. This method raises other important considerations, such as employee adoption, ticket interception, and proactive capabilities.\\n\\nNeither calculation is wrong. The former is a narrower metric that focuses on the efficacy of your virtual agent, while the latter measures its total impact on your support team’s workload. Before deciding how to calculate the resolution rate, you need to know what you’re trying to achieve with your support organization.\\n\\nRead more >\\n\\nWith an in-depth understanding of the resolution rate, companies can incrementally improve the impact of their virtual agent. This means identifying the right limiting factors to address, be it adoption, deeper integrations, or resource creation. Real-time insight into the questions employees ask and the problems they have makes it easier to know which levers to pull.\\n\\nNote that there is an additional metric — deflection rate — that's often confused with resolution rate. Deflection rate is defined as the rate that automated and self-help resources satisfy service demand that would otherwise be handled by assisted service staff. It’s a suitable metric if your goal is to reduce employee calls to the support hotline and instead rely on digital channels. However, it should not be confused with the resolution rate, which focuses instead on the percentage of employee support issues resolved end-to-end, without input from the support team.\\n\\nSeagen saves time and money by maximizing its resolution rate\\n\\nSeagen — a leading biotechnology firm specializing in cancer treatments — uses Moveworks to solve support issues in seconds. One of the primary advantages of its virtual agent, known internally as Dr. Botson, is its ability to solve employee issues end-to-end. Rapidly achieving over 30% resolution, Dr. Botson’s already broad abilities and knowledge were tweaked and expanded to deal with an increasing number of use cases.\\n\\nIt's easy to get lost in the numbers, but in a larger sense, it’s clear this bot has an enormous impact on Seagen’s business, buying back over 60,000 hours of time scientists could spend curing cancer and saving the company over one million dollars per year. The numbers will continue to grow as Seagen maximizes its resolution rate.\\n\\nFigure 1: Seagen’s virtual agent instantly resolves employees’ problems, tackling an increasing number of issues over time.\\n\\nTime to value (TTV)\\n\\nYour virtual agent should make a rapid impact.\\n\\nTraditional software solutions focus on go-live dates. But with virtual agents, you can’t just think about how long the implementation time will be. You have to think about how much value the bot will deliver on day one. You have to think about how long it will take for your company to get value from your investment.\\n\\nValue is measured by the benefit you — the customer — expect to receive, and time to value (TTV) is how long it takes to get to that benefit. To get a handle on TTV, you need to deeply understand your business objectives and your virtual agent’s role in getting you to the next benchmark. A meaningful result could be increasing your resolution rate, decreasing the amount of time it takes to incorporate a new use case, or keeping the support team on budget. The important thing is to pick a metric and measure how long it takes to get to a predefined milestone.\\n\\nImplementing an AI solution is complicated. It can take months, years, or never get off the ground at all. That’s why it’s best to consult with vendors about their implementation process and, when possible, consider how long it will take for your system to deliver meaningful results for your employees, your support teams, and your company as a whole.\\n\\nRead more >\\n\\nThere are two main approaches to building and maintaining a virtual agent. There are toolkit solutions that require a dedicated team to build machine learning models, dialog flows, and interception methods — not to mention the additional burden of ongoing maintenance and refining scripts as new use cases and resources are created. And second, there are ready-made solutions that work right out of the box, using AI to learn your environment as it changes.\\n\\nBut remember — implementation time shouldn’t be your only consideration. At Moveworks, we prefer to measure time to value because it’s so hard to get right. That said, the shorter the TTV, the sooner you’ll be able to spend time on more pressing projects. Some of the key values or benefits provided by a virtual agent include the following, but this list is by no means inclusive and will depend on your objectives:\\n\\nIncrease in employee engagement\\n\\nIncrease resolution rate\\n\\nDecrease operational expenses\\n\\nImprove the employee experience\\n\\nIncrease the time the support team spends on transformation projects\\n\\nloanDepot’s virtual agent delivered value on day one\\n\\nIn February 2022, loanDepot officially launched its Moveworks virtual agent — Elle-Dee — on Microsoft Teams. While evaluating solutions, Moveworks provided the loanDepot IT team with a comprehensive AI Readiness Assessment, which included insights into both its knowledge base and its employees’ most common IT issues. The team realized that Elle-Dee could do more than resolve tickets autonomously; it could also identify the gaps in existing knowledge articles and spot the inefficiencies with our workflows, opening a window into where to focus next.\\n\\nIncremental improvements in knowledge creation and identity management increased loanDepot’s support efficiency, resulting in a rapid increase in IT efficiency. Elle-Dee was up and running in just weeks. Since then, the company has witnessed a gradual but profound transformation, resolving more than 2,000 issues and counting with AI every month. AI allows its team to approach dynamic support challenges in an agile way.\\n\\nFigure 2: loanDepot’s virtual agent started solving issues from day one. Today, Moveworks-powered Elle-Dee uses AI to keep up with new use cases across support departments, ensuring happy employees.\\n\\nTime to resolution (TTR)\\n\\nYour virtual agent should accelerate support, so employees never have to wait for help.\\n\\nTime to resolution (TTR) is a support metric that measures the average elapsed time from when an issue is reported until it’s resolved. Many companies measure mean time to resolution (MTTR) instead, but this metric only tells half the story. MTTR measures how long it takes the support team to solve a problem in business hours. For example, an employee might be locked out of their account from 3:00 p.m. Friday until 9:00 a.m. the following Monday. MTTR would say the issue was resolved in two hours. But that’s almost three days for the employee. And that’s a lot of time to be locked out of an account, especially if you’re trying to close a deal or launch a new project.\\n\\nTTR has a significant impact on employees’ overall satisfaction with support. This makes sense, as users may be forced to stop working entirely or use workarounds until their issues have been resolved. Especially with employees working remotely, some issues — like not properly connecting to the VPN or being locked out of an account — can completely derail productivity.\\n\\nRead more >\\n\\nWhen it comes to evaluating your virtual agent, there are two ways to look at TTR. First, some issues — like unlocking an account or troubleshooting a VPN problem — can be solved end-to-end instantly. You should expect your TTR to drop from hours, or even days, to a couple of seconds for these issues.\\n\\nBut some issues cannot be immediately resolved. Think about accessing a certain software that requires approval from a manager or contacting the HR team about a highly personal situation. For these problems, a virtual agent should decrease TTR by accelerating issues through the approval process, rerouting requests to the correct assignment group, and allowing employees visibility into the status of their issue.\\n\\nEquinix accelerates support with its virtual agent\\n\\nEquinix used a virtual agent to decrease its TTR by almost a third. Based in the Philippines, Equinix’s help desk reads every ticket to decide which subject-matter experts were best suited for the job. Given that its international workforce is concentrated in the US and UK, Equinix wanted to avoid having IT issues pile up in a distant time zone.\\n\\nThe Moveworks Triage Skill allows Equinix's virtual agent to assign high-touch issues to the correct subject-matter experts — with the same 96% accuracy rate achieved by help desk agents. Simply by getting the issues into the right hands, Equinix has transformed the support experience for its employees and support team.\\n\\nFigure 3: With Moveworks, Equinix massively decreased the time it takes to get help at work.\\n\\nResource utilization\\n\\nYour virtual agent should help employees find the resources they need to help themselves.\\n\\nThe effectiveness of your virtual agent depends on the coverage and accessibility of your resources. That’s why one of the most important metrics to think about is how employees are using — or not using — the knowledge base articles and forms you create.\\n\\nAt a high level, resource utilization measures the percentage of issues your virtual agent solves with existing resources in your service catalog. If resources are easy to find and engage with, your virtual agent will be more likely to perform well.\\n\\nThat said, the best virtual agents play an important role by offering visibility into how employees use the knowledge bases and forms at their disposal. Some solutions will show which resources are missing and automatically incorporate new ones as they are created. The greater the number of high-quality resources, the greater the number of employees’ questions answered in seconds.\\n\\nRead more >\\n\\nWe work directly with our customers to improve their resource utilization and drastically increase their resolution rate, satisfaction score, and other metrics by asking three questions:\\n\\nAre your resources easy to find with the virtual agent?\\n\\nAre your resources easy to engage with on the virtual agent?\\n\\nDoes your virtual agent reveal information gaps?\\n\\nThe best virtual agents expose inefficiencies, offering a comprehensive performance analysis of individual skills and shedding light on the most requested information. With these insights, support teams can see room for growth and adjust accordingly to boost their virtual agent’s resolution rate simply by improving the depth of their support catalog.\\n\\nBroadcom uses AI to build a better knowledge base\\n\\nBroadcom — a world-leading tech infrastructure company — dramatically increased the usage of its forms and knowledge base articles with its virtual agent. By making incremental improvements to its service catalog, Broadcom’s IT team systematically improved its knowledge base — filling in gaps, updating old articles, and retiring old information — so employees can self-service their own support. Today, their Moveworks bot, E-bot, automatically resolves 57% of all IT issues by making it quick and easy to find the exact snippet of information an employee needs to solve their problem.\\n\\nFigure 4: Broadcom increased its virtual agent’s resolution rate by improving its knowledge base. The chart above demonstrates a strong correlation between Broadcom’s resolution rate — represented above by a blue line — and the increasing number of knowledge articles — represented by the purple bars.\\n\\nBot preference\\n\\nYour virtual agent should be the first point of contact for all employees in search of help.\\n\\nIt doesn’t matter how many issues your virtual agent resolves autonomously or how quickly it helps employees if no one uses it. Employees might prefer asking questions at the walk-up help desk, sending an email, or filing a ticket through a portal. If you want everyone to go straight to the virtual agent when they need help, you’ll need a strategy informed by employees’ bot preference.\\n\\nBot preference measures what percentage of employees use the virtual agent as their primary way to get support. This metric asks: Out of the total users within a company, how many go to the bot first when they have a problem? With greater insight into which channels employees prefer, you’ll be able to push people towards channels that best serve their needs and the needs of the IT team.\\n\\nRead more >\\n\\nSince a virtual agent is designed to be more cost-effective and less time-consuming for employees and support teams — you want it to be a one-stop shop for support. But we all know changing habits is hard. Three factors determine whether or not employees go to their virtual agent first:\\n\\nAwareness: do employees know about their virtual agent?\\n\\nAccessibility: is the virtual agent easy to find and use?\\n\\nPerformance: does the virtual agent offer fast and accurate help?\\n\\nBy focusing on each of these factors, your team can maximize all the metrics mentioned in this blog. For example, many virtual agents require the user to do some initial setup — an initial login — before using the bot. But with a virtual agent living in an enterprise chat platform, employees have somewhere to go for help 24/7. And if the bot instantly solves their problem, using it will become second nature. With fewer and fewer employees constantly messaging the support team with basic issues, the support team will be able to work on more complex and fulfilling projects.\\n\\nBuilding one place for help at Vituity\\n\\nFor Vituity — an organization dedicated to transforming healthcare — a significant barrier to supporting medical professionals is that they don’t know where to go for help. The answer to their questions might live on the company website, FAQ, or IT portal. And each time they need help, they have to go somewhere else to find it. Meanwhile, support teams are flooded by requests that steal bandwidth from longer-term digital transformation projects.\\n\\nVituity realized that — to create a lasting employee habit — the bot would have to intercept issues no matter what channel employees used. Known internally as Otto, their Moveworks bot is now the single place to go for help. Whether users need to reset their passwords, access software, or ask HR about a policy, they can always ask Otto, reinforcing the habit of using it as the go-to place for support. Otto is constantly improving through machine learning — understanding company lingo, automatically syncing with backend systems and adapting to user feedback.\\n\\nFigure 5: Employees want a single place to resolve every issue right away.\\n\\nIssue prevention\\n\\nYour virtual agent should engage proactively with employees to prevent issues.\\n\\nMost virtual agents today are reactive, offering a place where employees can ask for help when they need it. But increasingly, leading virtual agents are helping support teams to be more proactive, alerting employees to system outages and policy changes.\\n\\nIssue prevention tracks the percentage of issues your virtual agent can prevent by sending proactive messages and targeted communications. A major goal of any virtual agent is to free up support agents to work on projects that require their expertise. Decreasing the average number of support issues an employee has over time can make a real difference in how support teams operate.\\n\\nRead more >\\n\\nMany support issues are common. And support teams don’t want to spend half their day answering the same questions about when the healthcare enrollment period ends or unlocking a dozen or so accounts when employees forget to update their password every six months.\\n\\nTraditionally, most proactive communication takes the form of mass emails. But the more messages you send, the more you’re ignored. With a virtual agent — it’s just the opposite. Since every message is meaningful, every one reinforces the idea that the bot is the place to go for consistently high-quality information. In fact, by sending targeted campaigns, companies that use the Moveworks bot have seen engagement rates as high as 72%.\\n\\nA virtual agent can help manage change and get ahead of issues before they get out of control. A virtual agent can save HR, IT, Facilities, and Finance Teams days of extra work by sending quick, targeted reminders or intercepting issues in public support channels.\\n\\nVerisk stops problems before they happen with proactive communication\\n\\nBeyond just resolving IT issues with their Moveworks bot — Vic — Verisk is now predicting and preventing problems ahead of time. When an employee’s password is set to expire, Vic reminds him beforehand directly on Microsoft Teams to avoid getting locked out later with Moveworks for Employee Communications.\\n\\nNowhere has proactive support made a bigger impact than in resolving account issues. Before Moveworks, the help desk would spend countless hours resetting passwords and addressing lockouts. But today, Vic addresses thousands of account issues proactively and autonomously without involving the help desk.\\n\\nFigure 6:To build one place for help at work, Vituity’s virtual agent — Otto — intercepts support issues no matter where they were submitted and solves them in seconds.\\n\\nSatisfaction score (CSAT)\\n\\nUltimately, the best measurement of your virtual agent is whether employees are satisfied.\\n\\nThe satisfaction score (CSAT), typically measured on a 1-5 scale from “poor” to “excellent,” is the most essential service desk performance metric to gauge how your customers perceive your approach to support. You may think that you’re getting everything right, your systems are efficient, your agents are productive, and your knowledge base is comprehensive, but employees may disagree.\\n\\nIn fact, most people don't like chatbots. So it’s not enough to just think about resolution rate, TTV, resource utilization, or TTR if no one wants to use your virtual agent. You need to think critically about what makes a virtual agent a good experience. What is a good experience? Well, it will depend on employees, their preferences, and their pain points. That said, we’ve seen some overarching themes. Employees want a bot that:\\n\\nSolves as many problems as possible\\n\\nIsn’t overconfident\\n\\nSends issues to the right expert, and\\n\\nDoesn’t waste anyone’s time\\n\\nA virtual agent that ticks each of these boxes is the key to happy employees and happy support teams.\\n\\nRead more >\\n\\nIn this blog, we've given you a lot of hard numbers to define your virtual agent’s performance, but what matters is do employees like using it. If they don't, your virtual agent will never get off the ground.\\n\\nAnd that’s why CSAT is so important. It drills down into the likelihood of your employees using and recommending the bot to others. The occasional survey asking questions about what’s going well and what’s not can reveal hidden opportunities and unlock the door to an even better solution.\\n\\nUnity’s employees love their virtual agent\\n\\nAt Unity, 91% of employees are satisfied with NinjaUnicorn — their Moveworks bot. This means that of all employees surveyed, the bot received a majority of 4 or 5 stars out of 5. Getting to 91% satisfaction did involve effort. Support teams worked hand-in-hand with the Moveworks Customer Success Team to ensure that they could constantly improve their customer experience. By regularly surveying its employees, Unity knows how important fast resolutions times are and what knowledge bases could use some upkeep.\\n\\nFigure 7: The key to a successful virtual agent — like Unity’s NinjaUnicorn — is an experience that keeps employees coming back. This figure features a selection of anonymized reviews of their virtual agent.\\n\\nMetrics drive performance\\n\\nMonitoring your virtual agent’s performance is the key to creating a seamless employee experience. This list of seven metrics is not exhaustive by any means, but it’s a great place to start.\\n\\nDepending on your employee experience goals, you can add other metrics to this list or just focus on optimizing one or two for now. Maxing out these stats will transform your organization, from saving time and money to redefining the entire support experience.\\n\\nRequest a demo to see the Moveworks platform in action.\\n\\ntechnology\\n\\nMore blog posts\\n\\nHow to unlock continual service improvement with AIOps\\n      \\n        \\n          Discover how AIOps transforms IT operations from reactive to proactive.

We’re launching what I believe to be one of the most impactful products we’ve ever built: Employee Experience Insights (EXI).\\n\\nHere, we see firsthand how business leaders face an impossible task: You’re constantly working to create a more efficient, more productive workplace, but you have no real way of knowing what’s slowing your employees down.\\n\\nCurrent methods to understand the employee experience fall short. We’ve all experienced workplace satisfaction surveys. They’re a great way to hear straight from your employees, but you’ll never get the full picture when only a small part of your workforce takes the time to fill them out.\\n\\nOther methods leverage data from the tickets that come into the service desk. Support tickets provide a treasure trove of information about what your employees need. But existing analytics solutions leave much to be desired since they’re only capable of reviewing the structured data within tickets, such as assignee, priority, status, and resolution time.\\n\\nWhile these analytics offer a view into the agent experience, they largely ignore the most important information. Unstructured text from the description of the issue, work notes, and comments actually tell you about your employees’ everyday frustrations. Companies try to track this level of detail with manual tagging, but this approach is unscalable and prone to errors.\\n\\nClearly, support ticket data is the way to fully know what employees are going through, but how can you access these insights at scale?\\n\\nMoveworks’ new Employee Experience Insights (EXI) taps into the information hidden in support tickets to reveal your workforce’s everyday experience. Using our own breakthrough techniques in natural language understanding (NLU) and machine learning, EXI turns disparate employee complaints into actionable data, so that you can act proactively and make informed decisions.\\n\\nStarting today, for the first time, you’ll be able to answer any question that work throws at you. Like:\\n\\nHow much time do Sales reps spend troubleshooting?\\n\\nWhat are the most common issues facing remote workers?\\n\\nWhich applications do employees need to access on day one?\\n\\nWhat drives dissatisfaction with our most critical apps?\\n\\nWhat were the biggest changes since last quarter?\\n\\nMore to the point, with Employee Experience Insights, you’ll know definitively which levers to pull to make the most impact on your organization. Companies like Albemarle are already using the unprecedented information EXI provides to upend “business as usual” and transform their employee experience. For today, though, I’ll just give you a taste of what’s possible, running through three key use cases.\\n\\nIdentify every team’s pain points\\n\\nEmployees regularly face challenges that prevent them from efficiently doing their job. To ensure that they spend their time where it matters most, it’s essential to identify and resolve roadblocks. However, conventional ITSM insights tools focus primarily on tickets and SLAs, ignoring the details hidden in support tickets.\\n\\nBy analyzing thousands of different issues, Employee Experience Insights offers a granular view of the biggest issues affecting each employee persona, allowing leaders across departments to remove inefficiencies, power productivity, and respond to employee frustrations as they happen.\\n\\nIs the Customer Success team constantly troubleshooting Zoom? Are engineers blocked by a finicky VPN? Are Salesforce glitches piling up at the end of every quarter? With Employee Experience Insights, you can drill down into each of these groups with intelligent filtering to determine which issues waste the most time and cause the most frustration.\\n\\nFigure 1: Employee Experience Insights filters issues intelligently by both persona and time.\\n\\nMeasure the impact of your investments\\n\\nPoor technology has a massive impact on employee productivity. With employees flipping between Slack, Dropbox, Zoom, GitHub, and a half dozen other applications to do their job, it’s of the utmost importance to ensure that none of these technologies is holding your people back.\\n\\nPowered by NLU, Employee Experience Insights breaks down issues to reveal what’s working and what’s not. This tool puts in-depth information at your fingertips, so you can make more informed adjustments and ensure that everyone’s tools are functioning at one hundred percent.\\n\\nFor example, with EXI, a sudden uptick in hardware issues becomes an opportunity. Instead of addressing each ticket as an individual problem, you’ll see that a growing percentage of new hires are waiting an extra month for new keyboards and monitors, compared to your internal benchmark. Armed with that information, you can dig deeper and find out that, perhaps, your vendor is experiencing delays. Instead of forcing employees to sit and wait, you can update your device policy, potentially making it easier for certain employees to expense their own hardware.\\n\\nFigure 2:\\n\\nEmployee Experience Insights reveals which resources, applications, and services are causing the most pain with a hotspot graph.\\n\\nPrioritize the initiatives that make the most impact\\n\\nOne of the most daunting challenges businesses face today is prioritization. You may want to build the best employee experience, but choosing where and when to act is easier said than done, right? With most support analytics focused on moving tickets through the pipeline, knowing which initiatives will make the most impact can be a bit of a crapshoot.\\n\\nEmployee Experience Insights gives you the information you need to take action. By breaking down and then clustering tickets by both persona and time, EXI reveals trends as they happen. External-facing teams are waiting five days for access approvals. Remote employees don’t know how to get a security badge when they visit HQ. The Chicago office files three times as many tickets about the WiFi connection as the rest of the organization.\\n\\nThis one-of-a-kind insight helps business leaders lead data-informed conversations. Instead of guessing, you’ll know exactly where to move resources to make the biggest impact. This could mean adjusting staffing, re-negotiating a contract, or investing in a new tool.\\n\\nFigure 3:\\xa0Employee Experience Insights gives support team leaders the ability to continuously track and socialize the impact of every decision and initiative.\\n\\nNatural language understanding turns data into action\\n\\nI hear you right now: “But I already have dashboards. How is Employee Experience Insights any different?” Well — it comes down to our NLU.\\n\\nEmployee Experience Insights relies on the Moveworks Intelligence Engine™ to understand and categorize every employee issue. Instead of requiring leaders to sift through tons of metadata, EXI leverages best-in-class language models trained on over 400 million support requests to break down thousands of complex, nuanced utterances in seconds.\\n\\nOur approach makes Employee Experience Insights uniquely capable of providing a comprehensive view of what’s going on in your environment. By illuminating inefficiencies across your company, our platform gives CIOs and other employee experience leaders an actionable plan to increase productivity and overall employee satisfaction.\\n\\nSolve your biggest problems with Employee Experience Insights\\n\\nIn my mind, there are two main approaches to problem-solving. You can take an individual issue at face value and wrestle with it endlessly. Or you can look at the issue in context to find a higher-order solution.\\n\\nAt Moveworks, we don’t just want to solve our customers’ immediate problems. Instead, we prefer to take a step back and look for opportunities to solve bigger, broader issues that render the original problems irrelevant. Look at your last month of support tickets: Are you tackling the biggest, hardest problems that are facing your workforce? Are you transforming your employee experience for the better? Is it even possible for you to easily answer these questions? Probably not.\\n\\nTo answer these questions, you need to explore the environment in which your tickets live. And that’s where Employee Experience Insights come in, breaking down every employee issue in real time and surfacing hidden trends. So you can do what you do best: finding lasting solutions.\\n\\nYour entire employee experience, on a single screen.

For this reason, we empowered our platform to move beyond IT, starting last year. Since then, Moveworks bots worldwide have answered thousands of HR questions. Today, we’re excited to announce the next stage: Moveworks for HR, a sophisticated artificial intelligence solution built for people teams.\\n\\nHR’s always been complex, but we have witnessed a sea change on an industry level over the last 20-plus months. HR teams have been put on the spot, responsible for creating the best places to work during a time of extreme unpredictability. They’ve had to develop health and safety protocols; address employee burnout and well-being; manage flexible and hybrid work logistics; and recruit, hire, and onboard. The list goes on.\\n\\nEven with increased investments in portals, knowledge bases, and other tools of the trade, HR is struggling. And employees… well, employees responded in kind, leaving their jobs in droves, frustrated by red tape.\\n\\nTo bring much-needed automation to overwhelmed HR teams, we’ve continued to invest in and develop our HR capabilities. As of today, the Moveworks platform helps focus HR teams on meaningful work, and employees get what they need by:\\n\\nAnswering common HR questions instantly\\n\\nAccelerating support for even the most complex and delicate HR issues\\n\\nIncreasing the ROI for existing HR systems\\n\\nAnswer common HR questions instantly\\n\\nEmployees have tons of questions. So many that HR teams spend more time bogged down by a queue of mundane issues than on the best part of their job — connecting with people. HR needs automation to manage the load, but even the most basic issues are nuanced, requiring solutions that differ from person to person.\\n\\nConsider a common question about parental leave. There are dozens of ways to ask for information: I’m having a baby; my wife is pregnant; we’re expecting; there’s a bun in the oven. An HR professional would know exactly what the employee’s talking about and what they need. But a scripted chatbot? There’s no way the HR teams accounted for every possible keyword or phrase an employee might use.\\n\\nFigure 1:\\xa0HR support requires deep understanding and personalization. With AI, we ensure that every employee gets a custom-built response.\\n\\nAn additional complication is that the majority of HR knowledge is localized. If a Canadian and a Spanish employee ask the same question, they’re likely to need two different answers. This presents a unique challenge for automation. A hardcoded solution will lead both people down the same rabbit hole. Maybe one will get the answer they’re looking for, maybe not.\\n\\nMoveworks for HR uses conversational AI to deeply understand what an employee is asking for and who they are. With this context, our bot delivers a personalized answer entirely autonomously. Employees can check remaining PTO balances, inquire about benefits, review company holiday schedules — and get information tailored to their needs, immediately.\\n\\nIf your goal is always to let employees pick the benefits, schedule, and work arrangements that best accommodate their preferences, you need something that understands the subtleties of language — not a pre-scripted dialog flow. Employees are expecting human resources to be, well, human. The only way to automate HR is to understand that truth and create the conversational, personalized approach that people expect.\\n\\nAccelerate support for complex issues\\n\\nHR issues are rarely as simple as a question and an answer. Again, this is where the human element of human resources comes into play. Why have I been taxed so much? My job title isn’t right. I’m having trouble with a co-worker. None of these issues have a simple solution.\\n\\nFigure 2:\\n\\nWith Moveworks for HR, even complex issues are accelerated. Employees can fill out forms, request approvals, or crowdsource support directly in chat.\\n\\nMoveworks automates many issues all by itself, but some situations will always require a person to step in and help out. Our AI routes issues to the right specialist or manager for approvals to make this handoff seamless, even if the employee has no idea who that person is or what department they’re in. Employees can fill out forms directly on their chat platform. And it’s even possible to crowdsource support with our Channel Resolver.\\n\\nThe beauty of Moveworks is that — no matter the question — our bot can listen, understand, step in, and offer help, whether that help is completely resolving an issue or understanding the domain well enough to get an issue to the right specialist. Employees get the support they need, and HR professionals get questions they’re specially qualified to answer. It’s a win-win.\\n\\nIncrease the ROI of existing HR systems\\n\\nNot all questions are related to employment, payroll, or contracts. In fact, one of the most common questions employees ask HR is: “What’s the wi-fi password?” Why? HR is often the first point of contact for employees who have questions about their work environment.\\n\\nEmployees aren’t thinking about complex backend reporting systems or the support org structure when they have a question. They just want their questions answered. A single company might have multiple HR information systems, in addition to other systems to deal with IT, finance, and facilities issues. And while some of these questions might not be HR’s personal responsibility, HR has to be prepared to help.\\n\\nInstead of forcing employees to learn yet another system, Moveworks for HR offers a single place for employees to get help. Manage a life event, request an employment verification letter, find tax forms, approve expenses, and update healthcare benefits — our platform can help with all these use cases and more.\\n\\nFigure 3: Moveworks for HR unifies existing HR systems to provide the best up-to-date answer or action.\\n\\nKeeping track of all these disconnected systems is just as frustrating for HR teams. Manually updating a dialog flow every time you adjust the return to office plan is more trouble than it’s worth. HR teams just don’t have the resources.\\n\\nHR teams can now plug Moveworks for HR into existing systems — like ServiceNow, Jira, Workday, SharePoint, Simpplr, Guru, Confluence, and more — and it serves up the best possible answer or action. And as new information is added, it’s automatically incorporated into Moveworks’ repertoire. Update the return to office policy? Moveworks knows, and next time someone asks, we surface the new policy, not the information from last week.\\n\\nHR is complex — AI can make sense of it\\n\\nToday’s HR departments — at least the forward-thinking ones — are looking for tools to simplify their workdays and their employees’ workdays.\\n\\nThe problem is that the complexity of HR makes it extraordinarily difficult to automate even the simplest of their responsibilities. The only way to untangle this complexity is with a genuinely smart AI. An AI that automatically incorporates new information, understands HR-specific terminology, and is empowered to act — whether that means completely resolving an issue or directing it to the right specialist.\\n\\nMoveworks for HR uses layer upon layer of machine learning models to engage employees individually, letting them dictate the flow of the conversation. Our AI analyzes every request, weighing every possible response in real time — considering location, language preference, security permissions, and more — to decide and surface the best possible response for each employee. In short, employees ask for what they want, and they get it. Immediately.\\n\\nIt takes a lot of behind-the-scenes complexity to create an experience this simple. Anybody can throw together a bot that can deal with a couple of use cases. If you want a bot that does everything, you need real AI.\\n\\nThe future of HR is AI\\n\\nAll eyes are on HR leaders right now, many of whom have been tasked with reimagining the future of their company’s employee experience. But to create a culture that empowers and supports employees, HR needs to spend their time doing meaningful work and less time chugging through endless support queues.\\n\\nHere at Moveworks, we realize that every employee deserves to work at the best workplace. To build that workplace — where no employee is left behind — HR teams can’t rely on a solution that’ll only solve a narrow set of use cases. They need a comprehensive platform powered by AI. They need Moveworks for HR.\\n\\nLet your HR team get back to work that matters with Moveworks — request a demo!\\n\\nproduct features\\n\\nMore blog posts\\n\\nHow to unlock continual service improvement with AIOps\\n      \\n        \\n          Discover how AIOps transforms IT operations from reactive to proactive.

AI is no longer just nice to have. It’s as important a building block for your organization as any other.\\n\\nAI has become so ubiquitous that Forrester estimates that by 2025 one hundred percent of companies will leverage it. AI’s economic contributions have become so vast, PwC forecasts that AI will contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. The momentum behind AI is accelerating at a breakneck pace, and more are taking notice — haven't you heard of chatGPT?\\n\\nAI has emerged from merely a technology concern amongst data scientists and machine learning wizards. All of a sudden, discussion of large language models (LLMs) has become commonplace in boardrooms, where leaders deliberate over the right conversational AI strategy for their organizations.\\n\\nAs a business leader, you can’t afford not to be evaluating AI use cases. The opportunity cost is too high, and the potential benefits are too significant. However, in this economy, you also can’t afford to make big investments in AI unless they pay off.\\xa0 The problem is, as research shows, more than 90 percent of AI projects fail. Clearly, you need AI, but there’s no room for experimentation or educated guesses. You’re stuck between a rock and a hard place. So what do you do?\\n\\nIn my last blog, I discussed how to make AI practical. There are a few critical steps to consider here. When evaluating AI for your organization, you first need to identify the business objectives you seek to execute against, and this needs to be done collaboratively between your Technology (IT, Data Science, etc.) and Business teams. Ensuring this alignment is critical.\\n\\nSecond, you need to define the specific use cases to implement and the level of effort, technology, people, process, and data capabilities involved.\\n\\nAnd third, you need to establish the success criteria and KPIs that you’ll use to measure outcomes. Having a framework in place to both assess the value opportunity and measure the value realized will help inform where to invest initially and over the long run.\\n\\nIn this blog series, I’ll focus on the third step, walking you through a framework for evaluating the impact of AI on your organization.\\n\\nAligning AI investments to business outcomes\\n\\nCountless research studies highlight the importance of tying technology investments to measurable business outcomes. We’ve all heard the saying, what doesn’t get measured, doesn’t get done. We take that same approach at Moveworks, grounding our AI value framework in three business outcome categories:\\n\\nFigure 1: Moveworks’ AI value framework is grounded in three key business outcomes: improving operational efficiency, enhancing experiences, and accelerating business transformation.\\n\\nImproved Operational Efficiencies: The ability of an organization to effectively and efficiently utilize its resources (time, people, capital) to achieve its goals.\\n\\nEnhanced Experiences: Delivering delightful, optimal experiences across your employees, partners, and customers.\\n\\nAccelerated Business Transformation: Fundamentally changing how your organization operates to improve its performance and competitiveness.\\n\\nOnce you define your business outcome categories, you need to establish impact areas and associated KPIs to baseline, target, and measure against over time. These will help inform your initial investment, gauge the investment’s success over time, and re-inform additional investment as needed.\\n\\nWhen working with our customers, we collaboratively define KPIs that map to eight common business impact areas that Moveworks’ conversational AI platform delivers against.\\n\\n1. Improved service desk efficiencies: Making the service desk more effective while reducing costs.\\n\\nImplementing new technologies such as AI, automating processes, and optimizing existing technology infrastructure (hardware and software) give support resources more time to focus on higher-value projects, reduce the time and effort required to resolve IT issues, improve the quality of service provided to end users, and increase employee satisfaction, leading to cost savings for the organization and a more productive environment for the workforce.\\n\\n2. Reduced manual processes: Replacing manual, time-consuming tasks with automated or digital solutions.\\n\\nBy automating certain processes, you can eliminate the need for manual intervention altogether. Organizations capable of reducing the time and budget required to complete basic tasks free up staff to focus on more valuable, strategic work. In addition, automated processes are often more reliable and consistent than manual ones, leading to improved quality and employee and customer satisfaction.\\n\\n3. Increased tech stack ROI: Getting the most value out of your technology investments, from your knowledge bases to your ITSM, to your HCMs, CRMs, ERPs, and more.\\n\\nBy improving the performance and efficiency of the technology stack, organizations can reduce change management costs and increase productivity in the long term, resulting in increased competitiveness, revenue, and profitability.\\n\\n4. Improved employee productivity: Increasing the amount of work or output produced by employees within a given period.\\n\\nQuickly providing employees with the resources and support they need to excel in their roles, automating or streamlining tasks, and improving communication and collaboration among teams all increase profitability per employee.\\n\\n5. Improved employee onboarding: How new employees are introduced to a company and its policies, procedures, and culture is deeply connected to their — and their company’s — success.\\n\\nThe right tools provide new employees with the knowledge, skills, and support they need to succeed from day one. By helping new employees feel comfortable, confident, and engaged in their work, overall job satisfaction and performance improve, ultimately benefiting the organization.\\n\\n6. Reduced employee churn: A decrease in employees who leave an organization.\\n\\nEmployee churn, also known as turnover or attrition, can be costly for businesses, leading to a loss of institutional knowledge, reduced productivity, increased hiring and training expenses, and ultimately reduced profitability. Organizations can improve retention, reduce turnover costs, and create a more stable and engaged workforce by reducing employee churn.\\n\\n7. Improved support scalability: The ability of a support team to effectively handle an increasing number of customers or users without a corresponding increase in resources.\\n\\nAutomating routine tasks, implementing self-service support options, and using data and analytics to identify and prioritize high-impact initiatives and projects all contribute to a support organization’s ability to grow. By improving support scalability, organizations can provide better support to their customers and users, even as the number of people they serve increases.\\n\\n8. Improved security posture: The overall effectiveness of an organization's security measures in protecting its assets and data.\\n\\nA strong security posture is essential for businesses, as it helps prevent systems and software vulnerabilities that can have serious consequences. To improve security posture, organizations can implement various measures, such as robust password policies, regularly updating software and security protocols, and providing regular training to employees on security best practices. Improving security posture has numerous benefits, including reducing costs, reducing reputational risk, and protecting revenue.\\n\\nFigure 2: Moveworks breaks down each business outcome into eight measurable impact areas.\\n\\nKnow the value of AI in your organization\\n\\nIdentifying the business objectives, defining the use cases and capabilities required to deliver against those business objectives, and establishing a value framework with specific KPIs to inform initial and ongoing investment are three important steps to take when evaluating AI for your organization.

But hiring an army of help desk agents based in a dozen different countries is out of the question. Even with the latest automation tools, ensuring high-quality support across borders is a massive challenge, requiring dedicated experts to anticipate every employee issue, set up workflows in various languages, and constantly maintain every dialog as the business environment evolves.\\n\\nThat said, every employee deserves to get the same support. It shouldn’t matter if they’re based in the New York headquarters, a satellite office in Mexico City, or a home office in Paris. But this isn’t an easy problem to solve, especially not without help.\\n\\nCreating a truly multilingual platform is only possible with an extensive network of machine learning models working in unison. This is where Moveworks can step in. We’ve worked to evolve our Intelligence Engine™ to take on the challenge of multilingual support, and today we’re proud to announce that Moveworks speaks French, Italian, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and English — with several other languages planned for release in early 2022.\\n\\nToday’s blog dives into the three approaches that make Moveworks a naturally multilingual interface where employees are confident they can get help, regardless of their preferred language. Our platform:\\n\\nSeamlessly engages with employees in their native language\\n\\nDeeply understands support issues in any language\\n\\nDelivers personalized solutions to every request\\n\\nFigure 1: Employees deserve the same quality of support—no matter where they are or what language they speak.\\n\\nMeet employees on their terms. No scripting required.\\n\\nMoveworks makes getting help at work easy for everyone, regardless of their preferred language. All they have to do is ask. Even if you’re in an English-speaking country, using an English-language system, on an English-language device — when you ask our bot a question in Spanish — it understands and answers back in Spanish. It doesn’t trap you in a never-ending dialog flow.\\n\\nThis seamless experience is only possible with Moveworks. Unlike conventional chatbots that rely on someone manually designating every employee’s language preference or forcing employees to learn yet another new system — we threw out the script.\\n\\nFigure 2: Keeping track of an employee’s location, department, and language preferences, a chatbot can surface information that's the most helpful to a specific employee.\\n\\nNo matter what language you use, Moveworks just works. Here, Marina asks in Figure 2 how many days of PTO she has. And immediately engaging in Spanish, Moveworks provides an inclusive experience where Marina always moves the conversation along. She’s not trapped in a dialog flow; she’s having a real conversation with actionable steps forward.\\n\\nTo make interacting with a chatbot as easy in English as in any other language, our first decision was to play to build on what makes our platform so great to begin with. Simply put, we let the employee dictate the conversation.\\n\\nAt every step of the way, Dynamic Flow™ generates clarifying questions to further understand requests, crafting a custom response on the fly. Each response is tailored to the specific user’s preferences and the resources available. Deep contextual understanding helps our bot uncover user intent and review every possible response in an instant, weeding out those that are irrelevant or in the wrong language. We’ve also evolved our probabilistic bidding system, Action Bid™, to consider and reconsider every possible path forward, surfacing next steps in the language — or languages — with the highest likelihood to solve the issue.\\n\\nOur bot adapts to language preferences in real-time to ensure natural back-and-forth communication, even when requests involve multiple languages or multiple users. It’s smart enough to adjust and switch seamlessly between languages to get users a solution as quickly as possible.\\n\\nFigure 3: It’s hard to process complex ideas with dialog flows. With Moveworks, the user determines next steps instead of following pre-programmed logic.\\n\\nImagine for a minute what it would take to answer Marina’s same simple question with a conventional chatbot in every language and location. Updating this same dialog flow in ten languages every time the business environment changes requires a monumental effort and a native understanding of many different languages.\\n\\nMoveworks doesn’t require a dedicated team to update and maintain dialog flows constantly. Our platform automatically evolves with your organization so that every employee gets the same, high-quality experience. And we deploy the same powerful Moveworks skills for every customer in every language we support. So there’s no need to worry about building automation scripts or templates.\\n\\nUnderstand employee issues — even the jargon\\n\\nFull disclosure: There are open-source translation services. But enterprise linguistic nuances are beyond simple translation. Other solutions just aren’t equipped to handle domain- or company-specific language. They require constant attention from dedicated teams to set up and maintain. And they don’t consider a user’s preferences, permissions, or location, risking noncompliance with company security policies.\\n\\nMoveworks speaks your employees’ languages, so they don’t need any help to get help. Every industry, company, department, and even team has its own jargon, abbreviations, shorthand, and acronyms. Understanding Spanish is hard enough; understanding enterprise Spanish is many orders of magnitude harder. The only way to solve this challenge is with AI, and Moveworks is the most sophisticated AI platform ever created to crack the enterprise language code.\\n\\nFigure 4: Moveworks breaks down and transforms complex requests into machine-understandable language, no matter the user’s original language.\\n\\nUnderstanding multiple languages requires a chatbot to anticipate an infinite variety of requests from employees, including requests that contain language-specific jargon or a combination of several languages at once. We made the decision to completely nail the foundations of English first. Using Collective Learning to analyze 250 million requests across industries and companies, the Moveworks platform is uniquely capable of making sense of any language in context.\\n\\nFrom there, we could expand our approach to other languages with our already powerful Language Core™, converting any user utterance into machine-actionable information. We treat every employee request as complex words and phrases with context and intent, not just as clusters of keywords. Within Language Core, natural language processing (NLP) organizes any language into structured data — disambiguating entities, analyzing grammar, adding accents, and correcting typos — to understand the nuances to each language we support.\\n\\nBut perhaps more importantly, our natural language understanding (NLU) focuses on domain and entity detection across languages to figure out what people at work need, no matter what language they use. Whether an employee asks for software in English or Portuguese, Moveworks can instantly offer up actionable next steps.\\n\\nFigure 5: Language Core™ goes beyond processing language at face value: it illuminates a user’s underlying intent. Even if a user flips between two languages or uses ambiguous terms, our solution resolves the issue.\\n\\nLet’s look at an example. Even in English, there’s a lot that goes into adding someone to a distribution list. Our bot has to diagnose and solve a very specific problem that involves knowing who “Gregor” is and what the relevant sales distribution lists are.\\n\\nWhen another language enters the equation, it gets way more complicated. For example, Marina’s request in Figure 5 has both Spanish and English words. Within the enterprise, English is often the default used for group names, software entities, and error codes. And our system is smart enough to know that and therefore does not translate all words. In this case, our model automatically tags any words meant to remain in English, like “worldwide sales” here. By preserving this phrase, our system can search for that group name and correctly retrieve the top options. If “sales” were automatically translated to Spanish, this request would have failed, and Marina would have to start all over again.\\n\\nThis is just one example to demonstrate how difficult multilingual support can get. And it’s so important to get it right. If a missing accent prevents an employee from getting an answer, they won’t come back. And if the bot is confused when the same words have different meanings in different languages, your employees aren’t getting the support they deserve. With a deep understanding of how different languages work and how enterprise language works, Moveworks enables everyone to get the same high-quality service they deserve.\\n\\nPersonalized solutions — in your language\\n\\nThere are thousands of potential solutions to every support issue. New articles and forms are added or become obsolete all the time. Conventional chatbots involve lots of manual effort to map each resource to a relevant solution. And this challenge becomes even more complicated when employees speak different languages and live in different countries.\\n\\nIt takes a new approach to thrive in this level of complexity. Moveworks provides the right solution — in the right language — in seconds. Our platform ingests thousands of support resources as they’re published, so every response offers up-to-date information tailored to the user, accounting for security permissions, location, and language preferences.\\n\\nFigure 6: Moveworks uses context to surface the most relevant answer to each employee in their language of choice.\\n\\nMoveworks serves up precise solutions to employees’ requests, such as snippets from long, complex knowledge articles, taking into account language preferences and permissions. Instead of requiring support teams to manually build out and update every single workflow, our Enterprise Cache™ automatically ingests new resources the moment they’re published, detecting their language and tagging them accordingly. Support teams don’t need to manually update or edit conversation flows every time something new is added.\\n\\nWhenever an employee has a problem, Semantic Match™ looks at each of these potential solutions, considers every bit of information, and matches it with an appropriate response. Our bot takes every disparate piece of data into account, from the proximity of certain words and phrases to the resources available in various languages to the location of the person asking.\\n\\nWith a 360-degree view of your organization, our language, proximity, relevance, and location models retrieve the most accurate answer. So even when an employee prefers Spanish or Italian or Portuguese or German or French or English, Moveworks can connect them with the right solution. So employees get a quick and straightforward answer in seconds that's personalized.\\n\\nFigure 7: Considering an employee’s location allows Moveworks to provide resources like country-specific policies without involving the service desk.\\n\\nIf an employee, such as Marina in Figure 7 above, asks about the current company travel policy — the bot can review her specific profile, such as her language preference, security permissions, and location. Then, it can extract the most helpful solution from a larger resource — such as a snippet from a knowledge article or an enrollment form — to offer her up-to-date information in Spanish right away.\\n\\nAnd as Marina continues to use Moveworks, the bot will be able to handle greater complexity and adapt to her changing preferences. Even in a constantly changing environment, employees can ask just about anything, using whatever language they like, and expect an accurate response in seconds.\\n\\nMoveworks is multilingual\\n\\nEmployees find conventional chatbots annoying and unhelpful, and support teams find them costly and time-consuming. And that’s just for people who speak English. For growing companies, supporting employees who speak a half dozen languages really is a make-or-break moment. Providing resources and experiences in your employees’ native languages sends a clear message that every one of them matters.\\n\\nThat’s why we built multilingual support into our platform. As we add new features and improve our machine learning models, every employee around the globe will continue to get the same instant, high-quality support.\\n\\nToday, our customers can offer AI-powered support to employees in multiple languages without hiring additional help desk agents or AI experts. And for employees, there’s no learning curve or configuration required. Getting help at work should be as easy as holding a conversation. We’re proud to say that with our platform, that’s now possible for every employee, no matter what language they use.\\n\\nContact Moveworks to demo and deploy our AI chatbot in your Teams environment.\\n\\nproduct features\\n\\nMore blog posts\\n\\nHow to unlock continual service improvement with AIOps\\n      \\n        \\n          Discover how AIOps transforms IT operations from reactive to proactive.

Google practically wrote the playbook on employee experience, recognizing that to build one of the world's best companies, they needed to attract, retain, and empower the world's best talent.\\n\\nOver time, other companies caught on. They launched meal services, fitness stipends, unlimited vacation, sabbaticals, and other innovative programs to keep up. Chances are, your company followed suit, maybe kicking off a mentorship program or even buying a ping pong table.\\n\\nBut when Covid hit, we all faced a pivotal moment. Companies scrambled to provide their teams with fast VPNs, stipends to set up a home office, and more time off to manage stress during these difficult times.\\n\\nAnd despite all of this — despite two decades of improvements to the modern workplace — these perks didn’t prevent today’s Great Resignation. Why? Because when half your team is in the room with you and the other half is in their home offices, work takes on a new form.\\n\\nWe need to redefine what it means to be a great workplace, again. With some companies permanently remote, others with new satellite offices, and many embracing hybrid work, our conception of the perfect workplace must change to reflect our new future.\\n\\nPut yourself in your employees’ shoes\\n\\nLess than a decade ago, your beautiful office headquarters (HQ) was king.\\n\\nThe world was different then. Enterprise chat platforms were just getting started. The only real game in town was Slack. Microsoft Teams hadn't yet launched. Artificial intelligence and machine learning lived in largely inaccessible PhD papers. And while the number of cloud-based applications was expanding exponentially, the market was nowhere near as diverse and complex as it is today.\\n\\nChange was coming, but it didn’t really matter much because there was always the office. It was so easy to tap a coworker on the shoulder for help or spontaneously brainstorm ideas over lunch.\\n\\nBut put yourself in your employees’ shoes today. Working in 2022 is incredibly difficult.\\xa0 People are all over the place. There are so many systems and devices you need to do your job. And companies are not investing in their digital world in the same way they invested in their offices.\\n\\nIn short, most companies are still focused on improving their physical HQ, when it’s really the digital workplace that needs an upgrade.\\xa0 We’re used to getting what we want as soon as we want it outside of work, and the office simply can’t keep up.\\n\\nToday, more than ever, keeping your workforce engaged is a big challenge with even bigger stakes.\\n\\nAs consumers, we have borderline magical experiences every day. Yelp can recommend your new favorite Indian restaurant right down the block, while Amazon helps you find the perfect pair of shoes with a single search. But at work, enrolling in a healthcare plan takes hours and hours, and getting a new laptop requires three different people to sign off.\\n\\nNo single initiative will help you hire the best people and keep them laser-focused on career-defining projects. And no amount of creature comforts matters when it takes days to fix a problem and your workforce’s drowning in red tape. You need a mindset that matches our hybrid world.\\n\\nToday, more than ever, keeping your workforce engaged is a big challenge with even bigger stakes. Over six million people have quit since the beginning of 2022 in the US alone. It’s not because they lost access to the ping pong table; it’s because they’re burned out and disengaged.\\n\\nThere’s a heck of a lot behind these problems: work culture, management behavior, compensation. They’re all hard problems to solve. But as a leader in IT, HR, or other functions focused on employee life, your span of control has certain advantages.\\n\\nWhile you might not have the authority to raise everyone’s salary, you can directly reduce your employees’ frustration and improve satisfaction by investing in your digital HQ.\\n\\nThink about it this way. Offices aren’t going anywhere. But the effort we used to put into our physical infrastructure should instead be invested in the digital HQ and the tools that help us be productive.\\n\\nThere’s been tons of innovation in recent years, but employees aren’t reaping the benefit — yet. Here’re a few places to start.\\n\\nSupport takes three days too long\\n\\nI know, you know, and your employees know what’s burning people out.\\n\\nIt isn’t working on an exciting new product or fighting for a deal. It’s the little things. It’s spending two days waiting for access to a Figma board so you can collaborate on a design. It’s constantly dealing with a spotty WiFi connection. And it’s not knowing when a $2,000 expense will be reimbursed so you can pay your credit card bill on time. We’ve all been there, practically banging our heads against the wall, waiting days for a solution.\\n\\nWhat we want instead is a digital HQ that’s even better than the office.\\n\\nWhat we want instead is a digital HQ that’s even better than the office. But to do that, we need to start with a strong foundation. Which is going to be a challenge, because the digital HQ of today is in a bad spot.\\n\\nLet’s start with something beyond basic: support. Most employee requests are relatively routine — unlocking accounts, provisioning software, locating health benefits — but still, they take an average of three days to resolve.\\n\\nThree days might as well be three years. Consumer companies have set the bar high. The speed of consumer tech throws the slowness of our workday into sharp relief. The best talent goes where they know help is at their fingertips, not sitting in a queue.\\n\\nThe baseline experience is inconsistent\\n\\nEmployees can now work from anywhere. It’s an amazing opportunity for businesses worldwide to find and recruit top talent. But it opens the door to a heap of challenges.\\n\\nImagine troubleshooting your Zoom connection at your company’s main headquarters. It’s probably not that difficult. You can walk over to IT and ask for help. Now, imagine troubleshooting your Zoom connection when you’re 8,000 miles away. It might be 7 a.m. where you are, but it’s past business hours for the US-based IT team. There might be a helpful knowledge base article, but it’s not in your language. You’re stuck.\\n\\nIt’s of the utmost importance to give your workforce the same experience no matter where they are — and it’s tough. But if you don’t think inconsistency is a problem, understand this: the people furthest from your HQ will be the first to exit your company. It’s easy to leave for greener pastures when getting the software you need to work is hard work itself.\\n\\nIt’s hard for people to help themselves\\n\\nThe last and perhaps biggest stumbling block is enabling self-service. It’s just not scalable if every time someone needs help, they have to talk to a person. Companies 100% realize this, and they try to rectify the situation with chatbots.\\n\\nNow, chatbots don’t exactly have a great reputation. In fact, they can be a nightmare. Companies deploy them, and employees ignore them, because chatbots don’t understand whatever the employee is going on about. Every interaction leaves people feeling frustrated and willing to do just about anything to talk to a live person.\\n\\nI’ve watched this cycle for years now, and I’ve seen companies adopt a new chatbot toolkit every couple of years, starting again from scratch. That kind of turnover should be a wake-up call; this approach isn’t working. You need a solution that looks simple on the outside, but under the surface is incredibly sophisticated.\\n\\nThe thing is, we’re primed for transformation. The landscape is totally different from a decade ago. It isn’t 2016 anymore. Today, hundreds of millions of people spend their days on Microsoft Teams and Slack. We're seeing an AI renaissance, with sophisticated new models that have figured out linguistic patterns. And more teams working asynchronously, meaning that digital hubs are on the cusp of getting the investment they deserve.\\n\\nIt’s time to take the future into our hands and take concrete steps to build better workplaces.\\n\\nWhat’s possible today\\n\\nFor six years now, I’ve worked directly with top executives at DocuSign, Hearst, Palo Alto Networks, and others to not just help them fix what’s broken, but also to help them find new ways to inspire their people again.\\n\\nI found that the future of work isn’t more perks. It’s AI.\\n\\nIt’s not the surface-level perks that keep people coming to work every day; it’s the fact that they’re inspired to do meaningful work. You need something substantial to simplify the complex work lives that your people have. You need a digital HQ that frees people to do their best work in the same way old offices did, and the only way to build that kind of digital HQ is with AI.\\n\\nAutomation isn’t enough. Helping people requires a deep understanding of conversation. And that’s possible with a sophisticated AI platform.\\n\\nHere at Moveworks, we want to do more than fix everyday problems. We want to help our customers create a magical experience for their employees. This is the idea that’s motivated us to create a new kind of employee experience platform.\\n\\nWe started by thinking, What are the hallmarks of an incredible digital experience? What’s going to attract, retain, and empower employees in the same way that Google did, decades ago?\\n\\nTo deliver on this promise of a workplace that puts employee experience first, it’s going to take AI.\\n\\n1. AI that understands what employees need\\n\\nWhen it comes to AI, there’s a big difference between some basic automation cooked up by a couple of engineers and genuinely intelligent models capable of conversation.\\n\\nReal-deal AI — AI built over the course of years by a team of engineers — understands exactly what someone is asking for, even if they don’t know what they’re asking for. It treats every question as complex words and phrases with different context and intent, not just as clusters of keywords. And because of all this effort, this AI can make sense of incredibly ambiguous issues: My screen turned blue. I think I need the link to the security training. ¿Cómo configuro mi 401k?\\n\\nHappy employees are focused on meaningful work — not trying to explain their problems to a chatbot for the hundredth time. Some dinky chatbot dialog flow isn’t the solution. Automation isn’t enough. Helping people requires a deep understanding of conversation. And that’s possible with a sophisticated AI platform.\\n\\n2. AI that surfaces solutions in seconds\\n\\nFlexibility and adaptability are essential to an effective digital HQ. People within the same company often have wildly different work preferences. When new resources, better answers, and updated platforms are added every day, a pre-scripted conversation won’t have the flexibility to keep up.\\n\\nA probabilistic system, on the other hand, looks at every possible path forward at each turn of the conversation — serving up a form to get a new laptop, sending a troubleshooting article, or creating a ticket.\\n\\nFor support teams, it’s a massive burden to craft a personalized answer, every time an employee has a question. AI, meanwhile, can consider an infinity of factors in its response: the employee’s location, department, seniority, preferred language, and security permissions. It then decides the best answer for this specific user in a tenth of a millisecond.\\n\\n3. AI that turns resources into answers\\n\\nAnswers live deep inside hundreds of different company resources and systems: ITSM and HRIS portals, knowledge bases, etc. Employees shouldn't waste important time sifting through all these documents to get help.\\n\\nYou need AI capable of automatically ingesting, standardizing, scanning, annotating, and conversationalizing every knowledge article, form, FAQ, user record, and more into simple, annotated snippets. You need technology that can understand rules and entitlements, which ensure the right information is served every time. Getting help shouldn’t just be fast; it should be easy.\\n\\n4. AI that prevents problems before they happen\\n\\nA good employee experience depends on your employees knowing what’s going on. But many organizations still use conventional communications strategies that are noisy, impersonal, and fundamentally not interactive. These traditional approaches only get about 10% engagement, leaving the other 90% of the workforce out of the loop.\\n\\nWith AI, you can target a specific audience, sending the right information to the right place at the right time. Employees can even get follow-up questions answered directly in the chat platform where they’re already working.\\n\\nPeople don’t forget to update Chrome, overlook the benefits enrollment period, or even miss company Happy Hours when their digital world is seamlessly integrated.\\n\\n5. AI that fixes what’s broken the moment it breaks\\n\\nYou can’t build a better employee experience without feedback. When you know that resetting a password or finding a particular conference room is a common pain point, you can build resources to prevent people from getting locked out or lost.\\n\\nBut it’s not just about how to respond when things go wrong.\\n\\nSitting down every two weeks to discuss improvements won’t create the experience your employees expect. You need an AI system that automatically and intelligently incorporates feedback, allowing it to continuously improve over time.\\n\\nWith AI, it is possible to create an employee experience that’s resilient to change. AI isn’t just about automating onboarding tasks or expediting approvals. It’s also about helping your teams make thousands of tiny improvements in real time, transforming everyday frustrations into nonevents with every update.\\n\\nWe’ve done all of the above at Moveworks — and at hundreds of companies around the world. The result is something far more transformational than a chatbot. We built something that’s never been built before — an employee experience built to last.\\n\\nGive your employees the digital experience they deserve\\n\\nOur current way of working isn’t working. But we have the technology and knowledge to make it better — to create an employee experience that’s almost magical.\\n\\nWe’re taking employee experience out of the office and into the digital world, working backward from the experience we want and building the technology we need to get there. As we witness millions of employees using Moveworks every day, all over the world, we see something that we can only describe as Worktopia. It’s a place where everyone focuses on the work that matters.\\n\\nWe can build a workplace where employees don’t wait for help, where everyone’s engaged, where the experience keeps improving, and — most importantly — where people are put first no matter where they work or the language they speak. It’s possible. I’ve seen it happen at companies from Autodesk to Wellstar. They’ve pioneered Worktopia, and we’re beyond proud to have even more join us on this journey in the months and years to come.\\n\\nWe’re not here to solve a small set of problems; we’re here to transform the world of work as we know it.\\n\\nWe’re not here to solve a small set of problems; we’re here to transform the world of work as we know it. All of us, from Engineering to Marketing to People Ops, joined Moveworks because we share this same vision. A vision where AI has a decisive role in building the best workplaces on the planet.\\n\\nDiscover Worktopia.\\n\\nemployee experience\\n\\nMore blog posts\\n\\nHow to unlock continual service improvement with AIOps\\n      \\n        \\n          Discover how AIOps transforms IT operations from reactive to proactive.

The platform will offer Jamf employees 24/7 autonomous support for all IT-related issues — regardless of their location, role, and language preference. Moveworks will enable Jamf to scale a world-class hybrid work support model that’s efficient, cost-effective, and personalized to each employee.\\n\\nA recent report found that 63% of high-growth companies have already adopted a hybrid work model. But despite providing incredible flexibility for employees, hybrid models have created deep complexity for IT teams, and frustrating roadblocks for employees as a result. That’s why Jamf chose to roll out Moveworks: To ensure its employees get the highest quality support possible — no matter where they’re working from — in an efficient and cost effective way. In doing so, Jamf is demonstrating what best-in-class employee support looks like in today’s modern, hybrid workforce.\\n\\n“Our customers count on us to help deliver a seamless technology experience to their employees,” said Linh Lam, CIO at Jamf. “In order to do that, we have to constantly refine our own approach to technology and the way we support our employees. Moveworks is an exciting technology for that reason — it’s helping us deliver an employee support experience that’s simple, secure, and innovative.”\\n\\nWith 100% of Fortune 500 companies now using Apple products to power their business, Jamf has seen explosive growth in both the number of customers and employees it supports. But onboarding in a hybrid workplace means employees have to navigate technical challenges both in the office and at home. Jamf quickly realized that in order for IT to efficiently keep up with growing demand, it needed the help of AI. That’s where Moveworks comes in. When a Jamf employee experiences an IT issue, they simply message the Moveworks bot within Slack, and the issue is either automatically resolved within seconds or it’s routed to the appropriate contact for accelerated support.\\n\\n“It’s become impossible for IT teams to keep up with the demand of the hybrid workforce,” said Bhavin Shah, CEO of Moveworks. “AI is the only way to scale IT in a way that offers hybrid employees the fast, personalized support they need to be productive. Jamf recognizes this reality and is taking the initiative to build the support experience that will become table stakes for businesses now and in the future.”\\n\\nTo schedule a demo of Moveworks, visit: https://www.moveworks.com/request-demo\\n\\nMedia Contact\\n\\nSophia Xepoleas, Sr PR Manager\\n\\nEmail:\\n\\npr@moveworks.ai\\n\\nWeb:\\n\\nMoveworks.com/contact\\n\\nSolutions\\n\\nCustomers\\n\\nResources\\n\\nBlog\\n\\nSitemap\\n\\nPlatform\\n\\nPlatform overview\\n\\nMoveworks API\\n\\nSystem status\\n\\nCompany\\n\\nAbout us\\n\\nNewsroom\\n\\nContact us\\n\\nCareers\\n\\n©2023 Moveworks, Inc.\\n\\nPrivacy policies', metadata={'source': 'https://www.moveworks.com/press-releases/2022/11/moveworks-ai-platform-powers-jamfs-new-standard-for-hybrid-work-support'}),\n",

For years, tech support has consumed a significant proportion of IT's time and resources, leading many to implement rigorous tracking systems and create libraries of content to help employees help themselves.\\n\\nSimilar to IT, HR teams create enormous amounts of knowledge. But the real challenge is that HR answers are often complex and unique to each employee. So to get to a point where employees can answer their own HR questions — known as Tier 0 support — HR teams need to connect the dots between employees and content.\\n\\nHere at Moveworks, we asked ourselves: What insights can we gather on service delivery to help HR teams move closer to Tier 0? With this goal in mind, we analyzed thousands of real-world HR requests from several global companies to generate three key insights:\\n\\nHR teams produce a huge amount of knowledge to enable Tier 0 support.\\n\\nHowever, HR knowledge is highly personalized and location-specific, which makes self-service difficult for employees.\\n\\nNew machine learning techniques can overcome the complexity of HR issues.\\n\\nThe right answer already exists\\n\\nFortunately, HR already has answers to most employee questions. They’ve recorded tons of information on thousands of pages of knowledge articles and FAQs. When it comes to knowledge creation, HR has literally written the book — the employee handbook, that is.\\n\\nIn fact, when we first started to look into this challenge of HR service delivery, we found that the companies we analyzed had tons of HR knowledge. HR creates more content than all the other employee support departments combined.\\n\\nThe problem is that employees aren’t using that knowledge.\\n\\nTake a 100-page employee handbook. Most employees won't even scroll through it. And even if they read it, whenever HR updates the handbook, that information becomes stale and out-of-date. So what do employees do instead? They do what’s easy: email HR directly, flooding the team’s inboxes with dozens of support requests.\\n\\nClearly, there’s a massive disconnect between the knowledge HR spends so much time and effort curating and the employees who need answers.\\n\\nFigure 1: HR is responsible for creating and maintaining the majority of enterprise knowledge.\\n\\nNo two HR requests are the same\\n\\nHR creates so much content because, more often than not, simple questions have complicated answers. In some ways, automatically solving an IT issue is easier than doing the same for HR. A computer is a computer. The computer doesn’t change if an employee moves to a different country or switches to a different department.\\n\\nHR issues are fundamentally personal and inextricably linked to each employee’s unique location, department, and role. And that means that HR has to write dozens of versions of the same information, accounting for every different employee characteristic.\\n\\nTo bring this point home, at least half of HR knowledge — sometimes as much as 70% — is tied to location, while basically less than one percent of IT knowledge is geo-specific.\\n\\nClearly, with all of this knowledge floating around, finding the answer to a seemingly simple question can become frustrating and time-consuming for everyone involved.\\n\\nThink about a typical HR question: What are my benefits? Employees rarely include every little bit of context needed for HR to give them the right answer. Point of fact, in our analysis, only 15% of employees specified their location when asking HR a question. So, HR professionals must manually dig through various siloed backend systems to address each new issue.\\n\\nThis need for personalization makes Tier 0 support difficult but not impossible. With layers of AI and machine learning, our solution can look at an employee within the context of their location or role.\\n\\nFigure 2: Since most HR knowledge is localized, automating HR can be a challenge.\\n\\nThe key to connecting HR requests to answers\\n\\nTo sum up: HR teams build tons of content, but it’s inaccessible. Either it’s hidden away in some siloed, backend system, or it’s so specific to employees' locations or roles that finding the right answer is practically impossible without help.\\n\\nGiven this complexity, Tier 0 support is only possible with machine learning. Recent advances in the machine learning field of natural language understanding allow automated systems to break down HR questions, analyzing each one in the context of past conversations and who the employee is. Behind the scenes, we also need machine learning to leverage the resources that the HR team has painstakingly created — deconstructing every document, FAQ, and form into bite-sized information snippets.\\n\\nFigure 3: With Moveworks, employees get the support they need in seconds, no matter where they are.\\n\\nWith a manual approach, it could take days of back-and-forth between an employee and the HR team to answer a single question. With machine learning, however, that information is surfaced in seconds. Employees get what they need, and the HR team isn’t wasting time writing content that no one ever sees.\\n\\nWhat we’ve learned in our analysis of HR requests is that enabling self-service is a nontrivial challenge. But we also see a massive opportunity for machine learning to transform how HR teams deliver support. Large companies deal with thousands of HR requests each month, and the majority of these requests can be answered with the knowledge that HR has already created. Using machine learning to surface such knowledge means employees get support in seconds — while HR has more time to help those employees thrive.\\n\\nContact us to learn how you can use Moveworks to automate HR support.\\n\\ntechnology\\n\\nMore blog posts\\n\\nHow to unlock continual service improvement with AIOps\\n      \\n        \\n          Discover how AIOps transforms IT operations from reactive to proactive.

Hear me out:\\n\\nThere’s no question we’re operating in an uncertain environment. We’re wracked by inflation, key talent shortages, and pressure to cut costs across the board.\\n\\nIt’s no surprise then that service desks everywhere are under immense pressure to slash budgets, boost productivity, and ensure maximum efficiency — all while continuing to meet ever-increasing employee experience expectations.\\n\\nEven in this environment, digital transformation can become an expensive line item to justify. But that’s where AI comes in.\\n\\nAdding AI to your IT cost reduction strategy can help your service desk thrive in today's economy, unlocking new opportunities for growth and success while also driving an efficient, cost-effective support organization.\\n\\n1. Automate service desk busy work, end to end.\\n\\nYou're overspending on labor costs for repetitive and routine tasks that can be automated.\\n\\nOne of the most significant benefits of using AI is its ability to automate many time-consuming, routine, and tedious tasks. By taking care of everything from password resets to approvals to software provisioning with AI, you’ll free up employees to focus on more strategic work.\\n\\nIn this instance, AI not only improves productivity and offers agents the opportunity to gain higher-value skills but also reduces overall IT spend by reducing the number of tickets that agents are working on. Businesses are wasting money and talent on low-benefit, low-impact tech issues that AI can take care of.\\xa0 This way AI frees up your team’s time to focus on revenue-generating, meaningful tasks and providing employees with the best possible service — not busy work.\\n\\nFigure 1: With AI, IT support issues, like account unlocks or software provisioning, won’t slow your team down.\\n\\n2. Proactively prevent IT issues\\n\\nAvoid costly disruptions from predictable IT issues with AI.\\n\\nBy analyzing large amounts of data, AI can monitor your IT systems for unusual patterns and trends that would be difficult for human agents to spot. This approach can help you better understand what is slowing employees down — such as a service outage or software failure — as well as what other important factors are impacting the bottom line.\\n\\nIdentifying potential problems before they occur allows businesses to improve the reliability and stability of their support operations by avoiding or mitigating tickets rather than reacting to them after the fact.\\n\\nFigure 2: With AI, IT support issues, like account unlocks or software provisioning, won’t slow your team down.\\n\\n3.\\xa0Identifying service gaps saves money by reducing the time and resources required to provide support.\\n\\nIdentifying service gaps saves money by reducing the time and resources required to provide support.\\n\\nAI is perfect for analyzing vast amounts of company data and finding areas where support may be lacking. For example, AI can analyze the types of support requests that employees make, the length of time it takes to resolve those requests, and what resources exist to help that employee to figure out areas where support may be inadequate or inefficient.\\n\\nWith knowledge of where they’re falling short, organizations can take steps to address gaps by creating new resources or investing in new tools. With these insights, support teams can work to improve the overall quality of support and reduce the number of customer complaints or issues, ultimately reducing the time and resources required to provide support.\\n\\nFigure 3: AI can filter issues intelligently, revealing the real story behind your support tickets.\\n\\n4. Surface snippets from your backend support ecosystem.\\n\\nBy connecting backend support systems, AI speeds up personalized support.\\n\\nEven the most capable IT team can find it difficult to surface the best IT answer in seconds. It takes time and effort to sift through dozens of disconnected backend systems and pull a solution tailored to the employee's location, permissions, and language.\\n\\nWhen AI has access to your knowledge bases, ITSM, HRIS, and support systems, tickets can be solved in seconds. Integrating with ServiceNow, Zendesk, Okta, Workday, Duo, Slack, and more — AI can point users to troubleshoot their own solutions by surfacing personalized information snippets. This reduces the need for labor-intensive manual work and allows for more efficient and accurate data processing.\\n\\nAI can help support teams to better meet the needs of their employees — without sacrificing efficiency. By analyzing data and preferences, AI can surface solutions and services tailored to each employee — without wasting time and energy.\\n\\nFigure 4: AI can pull information from any backend support system, from IT to HR to finance to facilities.\\n\\n5. Support your people — all day, every day.\\n\\nStaffing agents around the clock costs extra. And it takes even more time and effort to ensure that the right experts are available across time zones.\\n\\nAI delivers instant support 24/7, so you aren’t missing out on opportunities to maximize your people’s potential. When AI provides support around the clock, employees can get help whenever they need it, rather than waiting for support staff to be available during business hours. By resetting\\xa0passwords or troubleshooting basic technical issues, AI helps to improve the overall customer experience and reduce the time and effort required to resolve support issues.\\n\\nAI's ability to work 24/7 can help IT support teams provide better employee support while improving their efficiency and effectiveness. Time is money, after all!\\n\\nFigure 5: AI works 24/7. If an employee is locked out of their account, they won’t have to wait hours to get help.\\n\\n6. Engage in every language.\\n\\nDon’t pay extra for multilingual support.\\n\\nSupporting employees who speak other languages can be expensive because it may be necessary to hire additional support staff who are fluent in a variety of languages. The alternative is to deploy a conventional support chatbot. But this would require your team to identify every way an employee could ask for help, train — and re-train — a generalized translation model, manually script out dozens of conversations, and then translate every resource in your knowledge base.\\n\\nThe usual multilingual support methods are not scalable. AI is. In fact, with AI, it’s possible to deliver near-native employee service in dozens of languages out of the box so that companies with operations in Asia, South America, and Oceania, can meet employees on their terms in a cost-effective way that doesn’t also discount experience.\\n\\nSeparately, AI is capable of translating information from your backend systems and ticket comments between the agents’ and users’ native languages in real time. Not manually translating thousands of knowledge articles or waiting for ticket comments to be translated can result in millions of cost and time savings.\\n\\nFigure 6: AI can surface the most relevant answer to each employee in their language of choice.\\n\\n7. Have thousands of conversations at once.\\n\\nEvery back-and-forth between an employee and the IT team adds a 1.75-day delay. AI can manage the back and forth, saving IT time and money.\\n\\nIn this economy, fast resolution of tech issues is more important than ever. While conversational AI can instantly resolve many routine tech issues without the help desk, what about the more complex, high-touch requests that can take weeks to resolve?\\n\\nEven when it can’t solve an issue outright, AI can accelerate resolution by prompting employees to provide additional info as requested by the IT team, updating employees on their tickets’ status, and nudging both IT teams and employees to take action on stalled tickets.\\n\\nFrom a financial perspective, of course, IT organizations that don’t eliminate friction with AI are leaving money on the table. But beyond the bottom line, AI empowers IT teams to support employees at the speed of modern business.\\n\\nFigure 7: AI can handle the back-and-forth communication with employees to add comments, nudge agents, check status, and cancel requests, so your help desk doesn’t have to.\\n\\n8. Get requests to the right experts and approvers.\\n\\nEvery support ticket that AI routes is time and money saved for the service desk.\\n\\nTriage is the process of sorting support tickets into different priority levels based on their severity and urgency. This is typically done by support agents who review each ticket and determine how quickly it needs to be resolved.\\n\\nWhile triaging support tickets can help improve the support team's overall efficiency, it can also be time-consuming and costly. Because it requires support staff to spend time reviewing and prioritizing each ticket, triage often takes them away from other tasks they could be working on.\\n\\nAI can triage IT tickets more efficiently than a person because it can process and analyze large amounts of data quickly and accurately. For example, AI can analyze the content of each support ticket, as well as information about the employee who submitted it, to determine the priority level and the appropriate course of action. No more waiting days for help!\\n\\nFigure 8: Many companies have hundreds or even thousands of assignment groups, meaning that service desk agents struggle to determine where to route issues. AI understands and routes requests to the right group.\\n\\n9. Manage more than just IT support\\n\\nYou’re spending too much time and money on tasks across your support organization that could be automated.\\n\\nAI is a versatile technology that can help employees with any question, not just IT questions. With AI, setting up PTO can be as easy as getting approved software access. Instead of filing an IT ticket or emailing the HR team, employees can simply describe any issue, just as they would to a professional, and let the AI determine and then deliver the right resource to resolve the request.\\n\\nThe cost savings of bringing together all support under one AI umbrella can be huge. AI can automate tedious, repetitive, and routine tasks that consume a lot of time, allowing employees to focus on more strategic and productive work. This not only improves productivity and allows employees to acquire higher-value skills but also reduces overall support costs. AI can help every support team avoid low-value tasks and provide better service to your employees and customers.\\n\\nFigure 9: HR can create a wonderfully positive work environment — but only if they’re not constantly dealing with time-consuming, routine issues. AI can step in, answering questions in seconds and sending info proactively.\\n\\n10. Improve continuously.\\n\\nThe best thing about AI? Its value increases over time.\\n\\nBecause AI systems can learn and adapt as they are used, they can become more effective and efficient. Weeks, months, and years after deploying an AI solution, it can perform new tasks and provide new capabilities because it constantly learns from your environment. When you add a new tool to your tech stack or update a knowledge base article, AI incorporates that information, surfacing it without effort from the IT team.\\n\\nOrganizations that invest in AI can expect to see an increase in the value of their investment over time, resulting in reduced costs and increased efficiency, which can also increase the organization's value.\\n\\nFigure 10: While every company is unquestionably unique, many use the same IT to conduct business. Thanks to Collective Learning, AI can grow as you grow, constantly adjusting as new needs arise and teams evolve.\\n\\nGet the most out of your service desk with AI.\\n\\nThese are exciting times for support teams everywhere. If you want to stay ahead of the curve, AI opens the door to massive gains.\\n\\nOf course, implementing AI can be a complex and challenging process, and it's essential for businesses to carefully consider their goals and priorities before embarking on an AI project. But the potential rewards of using AI are clear: improved efficiency, productivity, and decision-making, as well as new opportunities for growth and success.\\n\\nIf you’re not using AI, you’re wasting money on manual, time-consuming tasks. AI can automate these processes, freeing your staff to focus on more complex and value-added projects. Let your agents handle the hard problems. AI can handle the rest. They shouldn’t waste their time on L0, L1 asks or jumping over stumbling blocks like multilingual support.\\n\\nBy incorporating AI into your operations, you can give your business the competitive edge — and budget — it needs to thrive in today's economy.\\n\\nHow Moveworks can help.\\n\\nMoveworks has been focused on building the world’s leading conversational AI platform for the last six years.

While unsupervised learning has its advantages, it\\'s crucial to understand the role of supervision in fine-tuning and elevating conversational AI models.\\n\\nMy aim is to provide you with:\\n\\nA clear understanding of the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning\\n\\nHow both approaches play a role in the conversational AI landscape\\n\\nThe strengths, drawbacks, and utility of using supervised learning versus unsupervised learning and vice versa.\\n\\nWhy supervised learning is a must-have for conversational AI\\n\\nWhat is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?\\n\\nThe key difference between supervised and unsupervised learning is the use of labeled datasets.\\n\\nSupervised learning uses labeled data which means there is human oversight involved in managing training data.\\n\\nUnsupervised learning uses unlabeled data which means there is minimal human oversight involved in managing training data.\\n\\nWhat is supervised learning?\\n\\nSupervised learning is a machine learning technique where the model is trained using labeled datasets, meaning the data has been tagged or annotated by experts in the field.\\n\\nHow does supervised learning work?\\n\\nData annotated by experts provides clear guidance for the model to follow. Once the model has learned the relationship between datasets, it can be used to more accurately predict the outcomes of new inputs.\\n\\nThe benefit of this supervised approach is that the model can be fine-tuned to perform specific tasks in line with human expectations. That’s why, at Moveworks, we leverage supervised learning to annotate datasets for our conversational AI platform; this approach allows us to provide consistently accurate answers to end users\\' questions.\\n\\nWhat are the two types of supervised learning? Classification and Regression.\\n\\nClassification algorithms aim to categorize data into specific segments, like sorting dogs and cats, or to offer two more technical examples, identifying fraudulent credit card transactions from real transactions or spam detection in email.\\n\\nCommon classification algorithms include:\\n\\nLinear Classifiers\\n\\nSupport Vector Machines\\n\\nDecision Trees\\n\\nRandom Forest\\n\\nLogistic Regression\\n\\nNaïve Bayes\\n\\nk-Nearest Neighbor\\n\\nRegression models predict numerical values based on data, such as predicting a stock’s performance or sales revenue projections.\\n\\nCommon regression algorithms include:\\n\\nLinear Regression\\n\\nLogistic Regression\\n\\nPolynomial Regression\\n\\nDecision Tree Regression\\n\\nWhat are some of the drawbacks of supervised learning?\\n\\nThe drawbacks of supervised learning are:\\n\\nSupervised learning requires human expertise: Expert annotators play an invaluable role in guiding your model’s training, but they can be difficult to recruit.\\n\\nSupervised learning is labor-intensive: You’ll need to have a big enough team with relevant expertise to accurately label large datasets.\\n\\nSupervised learning is time-intensive: In addition to top talent, you’ll need the bandwidth to accurately annotate the dataset so that your model is capable of producing predictable outcomes.\\n\\nIn short, supervised learning offers more control and direction for the model, allowing for performance that is more aligned with end-user expectations. While unsupervised learning may provide insights into the underlying patterns within the data, this approach lacks expert guidance to ensure that the model\\'s outputs align with specific goals.\\n\\nWhat is unsupervised learning?\\n\\nUnsupervised learning is a machine learning technique where the model is trained using large datasets without any human guidance.\\n\\nHow does unsupervised learning work?\\n\\nUnsupervised learning operates differently, as the model is trained on unlabeled data and is left to identify patterns and relationships within the data on its own.\\n\\nWhile this can lead to the model discovering natural distributions in the data, it also means that there is no expert guidance to align the model\\'s performance with what the end user is looking for. This can lead to the model making inaccurate predictions that are not in line with the intended outcome, which is problematic for applications where the model\\'s outputs have real-world implications.\\n\\nWhat are the three common unsupervised learning tasks? Clustering, Association, and Dimensionality reduction.\\n\\nClustering sorts data into common sets, such as grouping knowledge articles into topics based on their content.\\n\\nAssociation finds relationships between variables in a dataset, like identifying correlations between weather and product sales — e.g. ice cream sales increase during hot weather — to make informed decisions on stock and sales projections.\\n\\nDimensionality reduction simplifies high-dimensional datasets — those with a high number of features or variables — by preserving their integrity, such as reducing factors affecting stock prices to improve stock prediction accuracy.\\n\\nWhat are some of the drawbacks of unsupervised learning?\\n\\nThe drawbacks of unsupervised learning are:\\n\\nUnsupervised learning can produce inconsistently accurate results: With unsupervised learning, the model is trained to discover relationships naturally, so it may result in what’s known as overfitting. Overfitting is when a model is trained too well on the training data to the point where it interprets noise or random fluctuations in the data instead of keying in on the underlying pattern. As a result, the model may perform well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data.\\n\\nUnsupervised learning requires a large dataset: Unsupervised learning requires massive training sets with a bare minimum of several thousands of data points to produce a desired outcome. For example, GPT-3, the model that powers ChatGPT, is trained on a whopping 45 terabytes of text data from different datasets.\\n\\nLet me offer an analogy. Think of conversational AI as a climbing ivy. Unsupervised learning is like leaving the ivy to grow on its own without any direction or guidance. While it may produce some interesting patterns, it lacks the precision and control that comes with supervision.\\n\\nOn the other hand, supervised learning is like guiding the ivy along a trellis, directing its growth and ensuring it produces the desired results. When it comes to conversational AI, which approach will lead to the best outcomes for your technology infrastructure? Let\\'s explore the benefits and drawbacks of both supervised and unsupervised learning in the field of conversational AI.\\n\\nWhen to use supervised vs. unsupervised learning?\\n\\nChoosing the right method for you depends on the application for which you plan to leverage the output. That’s also assuming you have the required resources, both tech and in-house experts, to accomplish your goal.\\n\\nIf you need predictable outcomes for new data, you’ll need to go the route of supervised learning. This also means you need to account for all the other requirements that come with it, like, labeling and annotating your datasets, personnel expertise, and above all, time to accurately label data.\\n\\nIf you need to detect surface-level anomalies, work through a recommendations engine, or try to create customer personas — unsupervised learning would be a better fit. That also means you need to take into account the requirements for this method, some of which are tech-focused, such as having access to a massive dataset relevant to your goal.\\n\\nUnlike supervised learning, where you can leverage programs like R or Python, you’ll also need powerful tools to work through the large amounts of data required to produce an expected output. Even then, you’ll still need to have a person to oversee the output and validate it for accuracy.\\n\\nTo determine what kind of learning is most relevant to your specific use cases, you need to look at the application of the learning method. Let’s explore a timely example: ChatGPT.\\n\\nChatGPT is both a supervised learning and unsupervised learning example\\n\\nChatGPT is a great reference point for the relative merits of both supervised and unsupervised approaches. GPT-3.5, the large language model underpinning ChatGPT, uses primarily unsupervised learning. Whereas ChatGPT itself applies supervised learning to further train the base GPT model and improve its performance for certain use cases.\\n\\nWhile annotation was used during GPT\\'s training cycle, there was no domain- or industry-specific expert input. This means that while the model has a wide breadth of knowledge, it could not accommodate more specific use cases without additional layers of models trained on more specific data on top of it.\\n\\nWhile ChatGPT is based on GPT-3.5, unlike its predecessor, ChatGPT has received additional fine-tuning using both supervised and reinforcement learning techniques, which provided the necessary direction and alignment with human expectations. This fine-tuning allowed ChatGPT to improve its conversational abilities and better understand the nuances of human communication — however, it is still incomplete, requiring additional training to address more specific use cases, such as solving IT issues within an organization.\\n\\nThe incorporation of both unsupervised and supervised learning techniques in ChatGPT highlights the importance of expert input in the development of conversational AI models. While unsupervised learning can provide valuable insights into the patterns within the data, it lacks the direction necessary to ensure that the model\\'s outputs align with the user’s expectations. In contrast, the use of supervised learning provides the necessary guidance to create models that can effectively and efficiently engage in conversation with people.\\n\\nReinforcement Learning with Human Feedback is the key to ChatGPT’s breakthrough performance\\n\\nThe combination of unsupervised learning and supervised learning with human feedback, also known as Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), has been critical to ChatGPT\\'s breakthrough performance. ChatGPT\\'s success can be attributed to the annotators who were involved in its development. These annotators used a multi-step process to provide the necessary supervision and reinforcement to the model.\\n\\nFirst, the annotators had conversations with ChatGPT using pre-defined prompts, creating labeled data for the model to learn from. Next, the annotators evaluated ChatGPT\\'s responses to these prompts, creating a \"reward model\" that reflected human expectations for conversational behavior. Finally, ChatGPT was able to use this reward model in real-time during conversations, adjusting its behavior based on the annotators\\' feedback through a process called reinforcement learning.\\n\\nThis process of RLHF not only aligns the model\\'s performance with human expectations but also allows for continuous improvement through feedback and iteration. The human element in AI training is essential in creating models that can effectively and efficiently engage in conversations with people. The combination of unsupervised learning and supervised learning with human feedback ensures that the model is able to understand and respond to the complexities and nuances of human communication.\\n\\nUnsupervised learning is a must-have for enterprise applications of conversational AI\\n\\nIn the world of conversational AI, the debate between supervised and unsupervised learning has been ongoing. While unsupervised models may seem like the self-sufficient, mature plant in the garden, the truth is that a well-tended and nurtured garden with supervised learning can yield the most beautiful and abundant blooms.\\n\\nThe importance of supervised learning for companies like Moveworks lies in the fact that it allows us to fine-tune our language models and bring them to perform at a high level of precision.\\n\\nBy leveraging the skill of over one hundred annotators to label training data and evaluate live performance, we can ensure that our conversational AI models are aligned with human expectations and can effectively handle complex, specific tasks — such as intent and entity mining — as well as rating the quality of answers and actions. This supervised approach allows us to continuously improve and meet the needs of our customers.\\n\\nThe power of AI lies in the combination of unsupervised and supervised learning, where the human element adds the necessary understanding to take on more specific use cases.\\n\\nWithout guidance and feedback from annotators, AI models may not be able to perform to their full potential. Don\\'t be misled by false claims, the truth is clear: supervised learning is essential in the quest for true AI excellence.\\n\\nContact Moveworks to learn how AI can supercharge your workforce\\'s productivity.\\n\\ntech\\n\\ntechnology\\n\\nMore blog posts\\n\\nHow to unlock continual service improvement with AIOps\\n      \\n        \\n          Discover how AIOps transforms IT operations from reactive to proactive.

Instead of quick answers, bots with pre-programmed lists of questions to ask and solutions to offer boldly lead us to irrelevant and convoluted answers. Once the conversation starts, we're often stuck with over-confident and frequently incorrect responses and hardcoded dead ends.\\n\\nFigure 1: Many chatbots are easily confused when users are vague or jump in and out of the manually scripted dialog flow.\\n\\nThat’s just not how conversation works.\\n\\nIt’s impossible to guess where conversations are going next. They take unexpected turns and circle back to previous discussions. For a chatbot to function in a real-life environment — an environment in constant flux — it needs to be flexible and think on its feet because figuring out what an employee needs can be a puzzle.\\n\\nHere at Moveworks, we’ve studied what it takes to have a natural conversation with a chatbot. The result of that effort is Dynamic Flow™, a conversational AI system that doesn’t follow a script. Instead, using advanced AI and machine learning, Dynamic Flow:\\n\\nGets to the right answer as quickly as possible\\n\\nNaturally switches between conversation topics\\n\\nSurfaces a tailored response to each employee query\\n\\nWe’ve written at length on our approach to these first two components. And today, we’re excited to announce Adaptive Response — a fundamental advancement to our existing techniques — which tackles this third challenge.\\n\\nFigure 2: Conversations can go in an infinite number of directions. Chatbots need to be flexible enough to keep up in the face of uncertainty.\\n\\nWhat is Adaptive Response?\\n\\nAdaptive Response levels up our already powerful conversational AI, generating a tailored response for every single employee request. By considering multiple relevant answers, a Moveworks bot confidently always has the right answer — or answers — to even the most unclear employee requests.\\n\\nSometimes the bot is confident that a single answer will solve a problem completely and with 100% certainty. But frequently, questions have complex answers where more than one answer is helpful and relevant to the user. With Adaptive Response, we can surface the right information after a single user exchange, without dragging them down a pre-scripted rabbit hole.\\n\\nFigure 3: Many questions have more than a single relevant answer.\\n\\nTo look at this challenge in context, Angela would have to play 20 Questions with a chatbot to get an answer to her question in Figure 3. She’d have to go back and forth, following a strict dialog flow. But with Adaptive Response, she skips that whole exchange. Based on context and past feedback, the bot infers that there are multiple correct solutions and surfaces both options.\\n\\nAngela is ultimately happier with this experience because she’s the one driving the conversation forward. With Adaptive Response, she gets the information she needs in the form of a knowledge base article and she is directed to next steps. The bot isn’t trapping her in a volley of questions; it’s curating her conversation in real time.\\n\\nAnd here’s the best part — whether Angela chooses the first option or the second option, the bot uses her decision to inform future responses. With every bit of user feedback, the bot will be able to handle greater complexity, adapting to changing user preferences over time.\\n\\nThese feedback loops become especially important because there’s an ever-increasing number of ways to resolve a question. From IT and HR to finance and facilities, every employee support team dedicates a monumental amount of energy to building out vast databases of forms and knowledge articles. Moveworks makes it so employees can ask just about anything and expect an accurate response.\\n\\nFigure 4: Adaptive Response leverages user feedback to keep up with complex and changing environments.\\n\\nSince all it takes is a single overconfident and incorrect answer from a bot for an employee to tune it out completely — it’s incredibly important for us to offer up the right response every time, even in the face of uncertainty.\\n\\nWith Adaptive Response, it doesn’t matter how vague a question or how multifaceted the answer. By offering up a spectrum of the most relevant solutions based on context and previous user feedback, the user has the freedom to make their own decisions. Moveworks gets people the information they need to get work done as soon as they ask.\\n\\nThe tech behind fluidly conversational AI\\n\\nIf you were to walk up to a service desk agent and just say “Zoom,” the agent would probably have no idea what you’re talking about. And yet, this is how people use bots all the time. Employees will type in a single word or a random bunch of fragmented phrases. Or they’ll ask multiple questions in the same sentence.\\n\\nA Moveworks chatbot can resolve just about any question an employee sends its way. It can provision software, pass along policy updates, take action on existing tickets, update permissions, request or troubleshoot hardware, look up people or places, surface knowledge base articles… The list goes on. The challenge is knowing — from all these options — what will best resolve an issue.\\n\\nTo find out how Adaptive Response sifts through all these possible solutions, we had to work backward. \\u200b\\u200bSince our goal is to give employees the best support experience, getting them what they need in as few conversational turns as possible is key. We want to make it so easy for users to get help that they never have to bother a busy support team with questions.\\n\\nThat's why we focused on building something that could deal with vague or complex questions and give the best possible solution right away.\\n\\nFigure 5: Answering even the most ambiguous, one-word questions is possible with Adaptive Response.\\n\\nTo address both of these challenges, we created a sophisticated approach powered by machine learning.\\n\\nFirst, the bot deeply analyzes the user’s question to understand exactly what they are asking for. With that understanding of the user’s intent, the bot reviews at every possible response in an instant, weeding out answers that it’s confident are irrelevant or not of use. Then, the bot explores all the remaining potential solutions, applying advanced models to determine which are the most relevant to the user given the available context. Finally, the bot decides how to best resolve the situation, offering up a made-to-order solution. Sometimes that solution is a single answer, and sometimes it’s a map paired with a policy update.\\n\\nThe result of all this backend effort is that instead of sending Lewis down a series of separate dialog flows, the bot identifies the best option — or options — from the available spectrum of resources, optimizing it to his specific context. Lewis gets what he needs with negligible effort. All he had to do was type “Airtable.”\\n\\nWith a conversational system that can fluidly respond to the user not through rules but probabilistically and in context, even the most complex or ambiguous question takes seconds to answer.\\n\\nThe key to conversation is constant improvement\\n\\nWhen you set out on a long trip, there are many unknowns. Even if you have a map of everything along the way — roads, hotels, roadside attractions — conditions change daily, and that means your static map becomes less efficient over time.\\n\\nWhat you need instead is a map that’s always improving, a map with algorithms that check and recheck conditions, alerting you to traffic and other hold-ups. This kind of map helps you choose your route wisely and avoid any backtracking or delays.\\n\\nA fixed approach to conversation is going to stagnate in the same way as a paper map. As Moveworks moves to support new enterprise environments, new employee experience departments, new regions, new industries, and even new languages, we must be hyper-aware of our ability to get employees the information they need regardless of uncertain conditions.\\n\\nThat’s why we built Adaptive Response. A fully informed, flexible bot will make the best decisions in every single user interaction. Feedback loops constantly tune our models, so the most relevant information is pushed to the top of the list. Every employee response — negative or positive — is helpful, opening the door to future improvements.\\n\\nTo deliver the best experience to each employee, you need a bot that’s flexible and gets better over time, instead of one that gets progressively worse. And with Adaptive Response, that’s what you get. A chatbot that’s smart enough to never get in the way of your conversation.\\n\\nSee what Moveworks can do for you.

With this major expansion, Moveworks resolves employees\\' requests no matter what they need, from IT support to HR answers to policy information.\\n\\nAs of this release, employees can describe all support requests to the Moveworks bot, available in business collaboration tools like Microsoft Teams and Slack. The Moveworks Intelligence Engine™ uses natural language understanding (NLU) to interpret each issue—then provides the right resolution by integrating with other enterprise software. Already, companies such as Palo Alto Networks, AppDynamics, and Nutanix are automating support across multiple departments with the Moveworks Employee Service Platform™.\\n\\n\"Everything we do at Moveworks is inspired by a simple idea: it shouldn\\'t take days to get help at work,\" said CEO Bhavin Shah. \"But to make that idea a reality, we\\'ve had to build one of the most complex machine learning systems in the history of the enterprise. Today, after half a decade, Moveworks is the first AI platform that delivers instant help to all lines of business.\"\\n\\nFounded in 2016, Moveworks has specialized in resolving IT support issues, handling more than 40 percent\\xa0of IT issues without any manual intervention for many customers. Yet other lines of business, including HR and Finance, face the same fundamental challenge as the IT department: an endless barrage of requests from employees that sideline higher priorities. Moveworks has therefore expanded to these additional departments, enabled by machine learning breakthroughs in understanding language.\\n\\n\"It\\'s really the small moments that create your company culture,\" said Elizabeth Wheeler, Senior Manager of Benefits & HR Connect at Palo Alto Networks. \"With Moveworks, we\\'ve made those millions of small moments effortless—by giving our employees what they need, when they need it. The result is that my team can focus on the big projects that move our business forward.\"\\n\\nA Single Platform for Employee Service\\n\\nA \"one-stop shop\" for every kind of support issue, the Employee Service Platform is the most significant product release in the history of Moveworks.\\n\\nThe platform retains Moveworks\\' core IT use cases, including unlocking accounts, provisioning software, ordering devices, editing email groups, troubleshooting errors, and more. And now, it also contains Moveworks\\' new modules for HR, Finance, Facilities, and Employee Communications. Between surfacing relevant forms, pulling answers from disparate knowledge bases, and routing complex requests to the right subject-matter expert, the platform resolves issues concerning all lines of business.\\n\\n\"Our goal with Moveworks was to make the entry point for support a natural conversation,\" said Saran Mandair, Vice President of Global IT at DocuSign. \"The results have been extremely positive. Our employees are now going to the Moveworks bot to get help in real time.\"\\n\\nThe most common type of employee service issue is an information-seeking question. Under the hood, the Intelligence Engine combines domain recognition, semantic search, and deep integrations to address such questions with answers from every department\\'s knowledge base. Employees no longer need to comb through multiple knowledge bases themselves, since Moveworks searches the entire enterprise for answers in seconds.\\n\\n\"As a fast-growing company, we need to add new employees, without increasing our operating costs at the same pace,\" said Ravindra Sunku, Senior Director of IT at Stitch Fix. \"Moveworks\\' AI platform has allowed us to keep our support costs stable, even as we doubled in size to more than 10,000 employees worldwide.\"\\n\\nMoveworks goes beyond linking to enterprise resources like articles and forms. Instead, the Intelligence Engine transforms these resources to display only the important information, in a conversational format, directly inside the collaboration tool. Users can, for instance, fill out an IT form without leaving the Moveworks interface in Microsoft Teams, or receive just the pertinent paragraph of an HR policy after asking Moveworks a question in Slack.\\n\\nAccording to Forrester, a leading research and advisory company: \"Firms have many systems of record for functional domains such as HR and facilities but struggle to provide timely access to these domains\\' services. Too often, the default for fielding requests for services is still \\'send an email to a shared inbox\\' ... Employees expect fast, consumer-grade access to the services and information they need to get their jobs done.\"1\\n\\nInteractive Employee Communications\\n\\nAs part of the expanded platform, Moveworks also released a new Employee Communications module, which enables company leaders to send personalized, actionable, and interactive messages via the Moveworks bot.\\n\\nTo revolutionize employee service, resolving support issues is only half the battle. The other half requires preventing issues, before they arise, with effective communication. From policy changes to system outages to software migrations, messages sent through Moveworks achieve dramatically higher engagement than mass emails, since they replace such emails with two-way conversations. The Intelligence Engine ingests each customer\\'s knowledge articles and documents several times per day, enabling the Moveworks bot to answer follow-up questions about these messages automatically.\\n\\n\"Most company comms today are sent in emails,\" said Amith Nair, CIO at Vituity. \"Guess what: no one reads emails! That\\'s why we\\'re shifting most of our comms strategy to using Moveworks over chat. It\\'s about making sure our messages go to the right people on the right platform, so they actually get read.\"\\n\\nThe Moveworks Intelligence Engine\\n\\nPowering the platform is the Moveworks Intelligence Engine, which received a comprehensive update to handle the diversity of HR, Finance, and Facilities issues. Unlike other platforms, Moveworks does not compel customers to fine-tune machine learning models, script out conversations, or program fixed workflows on their own. Rather, the Intelligence Engine automates employee service end-to-end, from the initial request to the final resolution.\\n\\nAll five components of the Intelligence Engine are now purpose-built to address any support issue. When an employee engages with Moveworks, Language Core™ understands the issues using advanced NLU, while Dynamic Flow™ handles the unpredictable conversation by generating responses in real time. Action Bid™ then chooses the best way to resolve the issue with probabilistic machine learning, triggering Semantic Match™ to find the most relevant resource inside the Enterprise Cache™, which contains all resources across the enterprise in a format optimized for chat. Together, they allow Moveworks to deliver instant help across all lines of business.\\n\\n\"The Moveworks Intelligence Engine relies on machine learning techniques that didn\\'t exist just twelve months ago,\" said CTO Vaibhav Nivargi. \"By creating extremely precise models for understanding enterprise language, we\\'ve solved a critical business challenge—while making the user experience effortless.\"\\n\\nMedia Contact\\n\\nSophia Xepoleas, Sr PR Manager\\n\\nEmail:\\n\\npr@moveworks.ai\\n\\nWeb:\\n\\nMoveworks.com/contact\\n\\nSolutions\\n\\nCustomers\\n\\nResources\\n\\nBlog\\n\\nSitemap\\n\\nPlatform\\n\\nPlatform overview\\n\\nMoveworks API\\n\\nSystem status\\n\\nCompany\\n\\nAbout us\\n\\nNewsroom\\n\\nContact us\\n\\nCareers\\n\\n©2023 Moveworks, Inc.\\n\\nPrivacy policies', metadata={'source': 'https://www.moveworks.com/press-releases/2020/06/moveworks-integrates-with-microsoft-teams-to-transform-enterprise-it-support'}),\n",

That’s when you know it’s time to scale.\\n\\nI’m proud to announce that Moveworks has completed a $75M Series B financing round led by ICONIQ Capital, Kleiner Perkins, and Sapphire Ventures with participation from our existing investors Lightspeed Venture Partners, Bain Capital Ventures, and Comerica Bank. The round also included a personal investment from John W. Thompson, Partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners and Chairman of Microsoft.\\n\\nThe market pull is real. It’s our time to scale.\\n\\nWe believe that AI has the potential to resolve many common employee questions and requests automatically. We see this play out every day at our customers, where we’re resolving around 35% of IT issues autonomously. This financing round and the support from our new investors will enable us to really push the boundaries of what’s possible with AI.\\n\\nYou can read the full press release, or check out the coverage in TechCrunch, Business Insider, and The Wall Street Journal.\\n\\nSince coming out of stealth in April 2019, the interest in Moveworks has been overwhelming. We were featured on Forbes’ inaugural AI50 list of America’s most promising AI companies. And I can’t tell you the number of prospects and customers I’ve met with during this time, but I know it’s a lot. No matter how big this company gets, I still enjoy the thrill of meeting an IT leader for the first time and showing them a demo of Moveworks. Their reactions to seeing Moveworks in action are energizing — AI is magical when you get it right.\\n\\nBut what really sets our company apart are the stories from customers. I particularly enjoyed Broadcom’s recent blog about how Moveworks resolved 38% of their IT issues in their first year using our platform. Thanks for the kind words, Stanley Toh.\\n\\nGetting AI to the point where it delivers real-world results — like what we’ve achieved at Broadcom — isn't easy. In fact, most companies are struggling to make it work. So I thought I’d share a few insights on how we make AI work at Moveworks.\\n\\nKeeping the hiring bar high\\n\\nBuilding AI requires a very different talent pool to traditional technologies: ML modelers, ML platform engineers, data scientists, data evaluators, hardware (GPU) specialists, and others. These people are well educated, highly skilled, and in high demand. You have to build a company that can attract and retain this kind of talent. To do that you have to vigorously stick to your rubric and hiring criteria, rather than succumb to the pressure of needing to grow the team by hiring someone who doesn’t meet your high standards. It’s the only way we can create the high-performance culture that propels our product forward.\\n\\nProductionizing research\\n\\nMachine learning news headlines are dominated by advances documented in research papers. While many of these breakthroughs deserve the recognition they get, there is a huge difference between building models that work in controlled lab experiments (with clean data) and building models that work in real-time, live production environments with real customer data. Machine learning and natural language understanding are such fast-moving fields that staying ahead of the pack requires a culture of discovering new research, testing it, evolving it, and then productionizing it. This is a continuous cycle, not a one-off event.\\n\\nOperationalizing machine learning\\n\\nOur production environments are typically running thousands of machine learning models at any given time. But models are not like normal code. They drift, they get overfit, they degrade in performance. So building an automated data and model pipeline that can monitor performance, then retrain and redeploy models on the fly is a necessity for us to operate at scale. The reality is that there are no industry-standard frameworks, tools, or processes for doing this. You have to build it yourself. So you need innovative engineers at every layer of the stack.\\n\\nStaying focused\\n\\nGeneral-purpose AI is still a long way off. Our success stems from our stubborn desire to stay focused on the IT support domain, and only that domain (at least for now). This focus has enabled us to become experts at applying AI to solve employees’ IT support issues. We have a huge catalog of labeled data, highly specialized language models that understand the nuances of enterprise IT jargon, a deep understanding of the processes that support common IT support use cases, and dozens of integrations into core enterprise applications. Staying focused has enabled us to reach the high levels of performance our customers benefit from every day.\\n\\n2019 has been an incredible year for me, my co-founders, and the whole Moveworks family. We all know that we’re in the early stages of building a really special company. We’re truly excited to continue this journey in partnership with our investors.\\n\\nTo our customers: thank you for your support, you’ve been central to our success.\\n\\nTo the Moveworks team: thank you for your passion and relentless dedication.

For the service desk, they’re perfect for gathering relevant information in a structured format — translating employees’ complex problems into concrete solutions. And in theory, forms should be just as helpful for employees, since they can offer an easy way to get new devices, request specific support, and much more. But here’s the simple truth: forms are too often a frustrating and time-consuming experience.\\n\\nFigure 1: Completing a form tends to be a complicated and frustrating experience,\\n\\nin part because employees must track down the form they need\\n\\nIn an ideal world, forms are effortless. What if you could ask for help in chat using everyday language? Your form could be completed and submitted with just a couple of clicks:\\n\\nFigure 2: Ideally, forms speed up the IT support process from beginning to end.\\n\\nTo create this seamless experience, we realized we needed to rethink every step involved in completing a form, from the user’s initial request for help to the ultimate resolution of their issue. In this blog, we will explore how Moveworks has transformed each step:\\n\\nFinding the form\\n\\nFilling out the form\\n\\nFixing the issue\\n\\nFinding the form\\n\\nLet's start with the big question: Why don't employees fill out forms? For one, an employee might not realize that a form exists to solve their problem. And for another, they often can't pinpoint what’s causing the problem in the first place. Improving this experience means helping employees find the right form — even if they don't know what they need.\\n\\nStep one is helping the employee figure out their problem. Suppose a new hire needs access to a certain shared folder. She might know the content of the folder, but not its specific title. And as a new employee, she might not even know if her company uses Dropbox, OneDrive, or something else entirely. Typically, solving this problem would involve reaching out to the service desk and probably some back and forth with her manager. But what if this employee could get immediate help?\\n\\nFigure 3:\\n\\nMoveworks surfaces the right form by first understanding what an employee needs\\n\\nand then surfacing the solution directly in chat.\\n\\nTo provide employees with this immediacy — we’ve moved the entire form experience into chat. Employees can engage conversationally with our bot, explaining their issues naturally. Since we've analyzed millions of IT tickets to understand how employees ask for support, our bot can quickly diagnose an issue and provide personalized, actionable next steps.\\n\\nIf this next step is to fill out a form, Moveworks surfaces it directly in chat, taking into account all relevant information, from the employee’s role and location to their security permissions. By moving the form-finding experience to chat, we remove many of the burdensome steps associated with the process. Instead, problems are resolved over a simple conversation — no more back and forth, no more searching.\\n\\nBeyond just simplifying the work it takes to find a form, we’ve simplified how employees\\xa0fill out forms as well.\\n\\nFilling out the form\\n\\nNow that the form is located — it’s time to fill it out. The problem is no one likes filling in forms. Spending minutes filling in basic information, checking boxes, and going through drop-down menus is not what most people would call enjoyable.\\n\\nFigure 4:\\n\\nMoveworks personalizes forms by automatically filling in relevant fields.\\n\\nHow do we fix this experience? We make it possible for employees to fill out and submit forms directly on their chat platform. By deeply integrating with both Slack and Microsoft Teams, a process that once involved many different platforms and steps can be completed quickly in one place.\\n\\nMoveworks further streamlines the form filling experience by using our AI-powered identity system. With this 360-degree view of employees and their IT environment, our bot deconstructs forms, optimizing them for each employee by partially filling in basic information, like an employee’s job title or email address. Users are only ever asked for additional information relevant to their issue.\\n\\nIn some cases, an employee only needs to fill out a single field. Then, our bot will ask only for that last bit of data, instead of forcing the employee to go through several repetitive fields again and again.\\n\\nIn the end, massively reducing friction within the form-filling process makes employees more inclined to complete the process, minimizing the amount of work for the IT team and accelerating solutions.\\n\\nFixing the issue\\n\\nFigure 5:\\n\\nService desks use our Performance Insights Dashboards to prioritize\\n\\ncreating new forms based on user feedback.\\n\\nIn addition to improvements in resolution time, with Moveworks it’s possible to dig into existing data and think about the most common services requested of the IT team over the last week, month, and three months. With Performance Insights Dashboards, agents can break down patterns and then create new forms or update old ones to keep up with demand. With this kind of visibility, the service desk can constantly improve their backend system, creating a positive feedback loop between what employees need and the resources available.\\n\\nForms without friction\\n\\nForms are hard to get right. But when they work — the results are dramatic. From unlocking accounts to troubleshooting hardware, fixing forms massively impacts the service desk’s ability to automate hundreds of solutions.\\n\\nFigure 6:\\n\\nMoveworks constantly invests in improving forms. By making it easier to locate,\\n\\ncomplete, and submit forms — an increasing number of issues are resolved autonomously.\\n\\nService desks expend a monumental amount of energy creating forms and building out a comprehensive service catalog that covers just about everything. But for too long, that energy hasn’t fully translated to impact. Working with some of the world's leading service desks, Moveworks has ensured their work doesn’t go to waste. With Smart Forms, employees find what they need in seconds — with a simple, automated, and in-chat experience.\\n\\nContact Moveworks to learn how you can use our Smart Forms to automate\\xa0IT support.\\n\\nproduct features\\n\\nMore blog posts\\n\\nHow to unlock continual service improvement with AIOps\\n      \\n        \\n          Discover how AIOps transforms IT operations from reactive to proactive.

AI.\\n\\nAvi Dalal, Product Marketing Manager\\n\\nMay 22, 2023\\n\\nlinkedin\\n\\nfacebook\\n\\ntwitter\\n\\nemail\\n\\nIt’s time to rethink how we measure employee experience.\\n\\nPicture this: you send out a survey to gauge employee satisfaction, but it's met with vague responses or unusable answers. You're left wondering what's stopping employees from providing genuine feedback.\\n\\nSurveys just don't seem to work — they're too subjective, and let's be honest, hardly anyone fills them out. Manually tagging tickets is no better, as it’s a time-consuming, unscalable task for enterprises of any size.\\n\\nBuilding and maintaining ITSM dashboards consume valuable resources that could be allocated elsewhere. And to make matters worse, existing ITSM analytics solutions focus on measuring agent efficiency rather than the employee experience, leaving you missing out on crucial insights that could drive business growth.\\n\\nWe need a tool that doesn’t require time-consuming efforts to manually review and tag every ticket, a solution that’s scalable, and can provide sentiment analysis of employee satisfaction without cumbersome surveys. And there needs to be a clean way to see real-time performance to understand your employee experience as it’s happening — not after frustration has built up and productivity has declined.\\n\\nEnter Employee Experience Insights (EXI), which leverages advanced natural language understanding (NLU) to analyze unstructured data within tickets. This untapped source of information is where real insights lie. Read on to discover how AI analytics will change the way we measure and improve employee experience:\\n\\nWhat is employee experience?\\n\\nWhy is employee experience important?\\n\\nWhy is measuring employee experience KPIs important?\\n\\nHow to measure employee experience?\\n\\nWhat is Employee Experience Insights (EXI)?\\n\\nWhat are industry use cases for measuring employee experience with AI?\\n\\nHow does EXI help you take action when apps and services need attention?\\n\\nHow to create an employee experience KPI dashboard?\\n\\nHow to improve your employee experience KPIs?\\n\\nWhat is employee experience?\\n\\nEmployee experience, often abbreviated as EX, is a holistic approach to understanding and enhancing an individual's journey within an organization. It encompasses all the interactions and experiences an employee has with their workplace, starting from the moment they become a candidate for a job.\\n\\nThe concept of employee experience is rooted in the belief that a positive environment and meaningful work experience foster employee engagement, satisfaction, and performance. EX is not just about tangible factors, such as compensation and benefits, but also the overall workplace culture, management style, and the opportunities provided for growth and development.\\n\\nWhy is employee experience important?\\n\\nEmployee experience serves as a crucial aspect of an organization's overall health and performance. The importance of EX cannot be overstated, as it impacts various areas of business success.\\n\\nHere are some key reasons why employee experience is vital:\\n\\nEnhanced employee engagement: A positive employee experience fosters higher levels of engagement, which results in increased commitment, loyalty, and dedication towards an organization's goals.\\n\\nImproved retention and lower turnover: When employees feel valued and enjoy a satisfactory work environment, they are less likely to leave the company. As a result, businesses can reduce turnover costs and retain vital skills and experience within their workforce.\\n\\nIncreased productivity: Satisfied, engaged employees tend to be more productive, contributing to better business performance, higher customer satisfaction, and a healthier bottom line.\\n\\nBetter company reputation: Companies that prioritize employee experience are often seen as more attractive to job candidates, improving their talent acquisition and creating a competitive edge in attracting top talent.\\n\\nHigher innovation: Employee experience encourages creativity and innovation by creating a supportive and empowering environment. When employees feel heard and appreciated, they are more likely to share unique ideas and contribute to the organization's growth and continuous improvement.\\n\\nWhy is measuring employee experience KPIs important?\\n\\nKeeping track of employee experience key performance indicators (KPIs) is essential to gauge the effectiveness of your organization's efforts to improve the overall work environment.\\n\\nWith these metrics, organizations can identify areas for improvement and drive more informed decisions to improve the everyday employee experience.\\n\\nEX has a profound influence on various business outcomes, such as recruitment, wellness, and retention. By understanding the relationship between these factors, organizations can develop a more comprehensive approach to nurturing a prosperous work culture.\\n\\nEmployee recruitment\\n\\nHigh levels of employee satisfaction and engagement are often evident through positive reviews, referrals from existing employees, and a strong reputation as an employer of choice.\\n\\nMonitoring recruitment-related KPIs, such as time-to-fill or cost-per-hire, can help companies fine-tune their talent acquisition strategies and ensure they attract the right candidates for the organization's growth.\\n\\nEmployee wellness\\n\\nEmployee wellness is significantly influenced by the quality of the work experience, which in turn directly impacts an organization's overall performance.\\n\\nMonitoring wellness-related KPIs, such as absenteeism rates, employee assistance program utilization, or job-related stress levels, can help organizations identify potential issues affecting employee well-being. By addressing these concerns, companies can create a healthier work environment where employees can thrive both professionally and personally.\\n\\nEmployee retention\\n\\nRetention is closely linked to employee experience, and monitoring KPIs in this area can help organizations identify, prevent, or mitigate the risk of losing valuable employees.\\n\\nRetention-related KPIs, such as turnover rate, retention rate, or reason-for-leaving patterns, enable companies to understand the factors driving employees' decisions to stay or leave. This valuable data helps businesses develop targeted strategies to improve employee satisfaction, reduce turnover, and maintain a competent and stable workforce.\\n\\nHow to measure employee experience?\\n\\nTo create a thriving workplace, it's essential to understand the effectiveness of your organization's employee experience initiatives. To achieve this, several measurement methods can reveal valuable insights from employees at various stages of their journey within the company.\\n\\nConventional ways to measure employee experience\\n\\nTraditional methods of measuring employee experience are often centered around collecting subjective employee feedback through various channels:\\n\\nSurveys: Employers can use different types of surveys to gauge employee sentiment, including candidate, onboarding, employee engagement, eNPS (Employee Net Promoter Score), pulse, and exit surveys. These surveys enable organizations to collect feedback from employees at critical touchpoints throughout their tenure.\\n\\nInterviews: One-on-one interviews, such as exit interviews or performance reviews, provide an opportunity for employees to share their experiences, opinions, and concerns. Skip-level meetings, which allow employees to communicate with managers above their direct supervisor, can provide additional insights into the employee experience at various levels within the organization.\\n\\nFocus groups: Gathering small groups of employees and facilitating discussions enables exploration of specific topics or concerns related to employee experience. Focus groups can stimulate open conversations and help identify areas for improvement or opportunities to strengthen the workplace environment.\\n\\nWhile these traditional methods have provided valuable feedback, the emergence of innovative tools and techniques, such as AI analytics, makes it possible to enhance employee experience measurement more effectively and systematically.\\n\\nEmployee Experience Insights: Reimagining analytics with AI\\n\\nMoveworks’ Employee Experience Insights (EXI) is designed to uncover crucial information concealed within everyday employee support tickets.\\n\\nBy harnessing our proprietary natural language understanding (NLU) techniques and state-of-the-art machine learning, EXI automates the data analysis process by translating scattered employee concerns into actionable information.\\n\\nAnd EXI goes beyond examining structured data, diving deep into unstructured data such as emails, chat logs, and support tickets. By analyzing this information with AI, EXI can uncover underlying issues impacting employee satisfaction and highlight areas that warrant attention or improvement that might otherwise go unnoticed.\\n\\nIn this way, EXI allows organizations to answer a wide array of relevant questions, uncovering invaluable insights into employee engagement, workplace efficiency, and core productivity drivers. From identifying top issues affecting remote workers to understanding employee dissatisfaction with critical apps, EXI provides comprehensive knowledge tailored to help organizations boost their workforce's overall experience.\\n\\nAll of this boils down to everyone from the CEO to service leaders having a more comprehensive understanding of your workforce and actionable insights that contribute to a better employee experience.\\n\\nFigure 1: Using NLU techniques trained on over half a billion support tickets, AI analytics can pull key insights from unstructured data, like IT support tickets.\\n\\nIndustry use cases for measuring employee experience with AI\\n\\nAI has the potential to enhance the success of your key employee experience initiatives across industries. Let's explore some examples:\\n\\nManufacturing companies enhancing employee experience: Providing workers with streamlined processes, up-to-date training, and the opportunity to work with cutting-edge technology leads to empowered, knowledgeable, and engaged employees who can contribute to the organization’s growth and success.\\n\\nTech companies cultivating growth-focused work environments: For a technology company looking to grow rapidly, AI can help identify bottlenecks and unblock your revenue-generating teams, creating a culture that’s conducive to accelerating expansion.\\n\\nFinancial services companies promoting cost-conscious workplace culture: If your financial institution aims to reduce expenses, AI can pinpoint the most resource-intensive applications, allowing employees to focus on their core tasks and increase productivity.\\n\\nUtilities companies fostering efficiency: Utility companies can use AI to optimize energy and resource distribution, predict equipment maintenance needs, and improve customer service. This enables employees to perform their jobs more effectively, leading to greater engagement and empowered decision-making.\\n\\nMedia companies boosting internal creativity and engagement: AI plays a crucial role in improving the employee experience in media organizations by streamlining communication, automating repetitive tasks, and personalizing learning opportunities. This creates a supportive, engaging workplace that promotes innovation, job satisfaction, and employee retention in the rapidly evolving media industry.\\n\\nHealthcare organizations prioritizing employee wellness: When everyday obstacles like problematic IT applications or long support wait times are addressed, employees can focus on their core responsibilities and prioritize patient care. In this way, AI creates a supportive and efficient work environment, contributing to enhanced employee well-being, job satisfaction, and, ultimately, improved patient outcomes.\\n\\nAI insights can complement and strengthen your company’s key initiatives, regardless of industry, by providing insightful data tailored to drive success.\\n\\nEXI helps you take action when apps and services need attention\\n\\nThe rapidly evolving technological landscape has made employees more dependent on more than 200 different applications, including Slack, Dropbox, Zoom, GitHub, and many, many more, to effectively perform their tasks. Ensuring seamless performance of these tools is crucial to preventING productivity losses in your organization, and this is where AI-powered analytics come into play.\\n\\nEXI provides an in-depth analysis of your organization's app usage and potential issues, enabling you to identify what's working and what's not. This invaluable resource ensures your employees' tools are always operating at peak efficiency, empowering them to focus on their work without disruptions.\\n\\nFigure 2: Not only does EXI let you slice and dice tickets by issue type, but also it lets you view common problems from the perspective of the individual apps and services used in your enterprise.\\n\\nFor instance, imagine a situation where an increasing number of your new hires are facing hardware issues, leading them to wait an extra month for keyboards and monitors. With EXI, you can spot this growing trend and take prompt action. After identifying the issue, you can further investigate its root cause, such as a vendor experiencing delays. In response, you can adjust your device policy, making it easier for specific employees to purchase the required hardware themselves.\\n\\nBy adopting AI-driven analytical tools like EXI, you can proactively identify and troubleshoot app and service issues before they escalate, ensuring uninterrupted productivity across your organization. These insights enable you to create targeted action plans and make more informed decisions, significantly improving the overall employee experience.\\n\\nCreating an employee experience KPI dashboard\\n\\nThe challenge of addressing employee concerns promptly and accurately can seem daunting, particularly for large organizations. With countless employee touchpoints, understanding their issues and addressing their feedback often become overwhelming. Enterprises need a more efficient and precise approach – and that’s where EXI comes into play.\\n\\nSpecifically, natural language understanding (NLU) is a driving force in identifying and classifying employee issues on a large scale. Using the NLU hotspot grid in the Employee Issues module, organizations extract valuable insights from tickets logged by their workforce.\\n\\nFigure 3: By leveraging AI analytics, specific team-related issues can be identified early on, which enables support teams to address and resolve these problems before they escalate, ensuring a smoother work environment.\\n\\nSo, how does this work?\\n\\nThe secret lies in implementing more than 200 cutting-edge machine learning models, which also power our enterprise copilot platform. These models enable AI to decode and understand various issues experienced by employees. Now, organizations can identify and classify employee feedback within these vast datasets, unearth hidden patterns, and address those concerns systematically.\\n\\nAI insights offer a solution to the complex task of identifying employee issues at scale, enabling organizations to foster a more engaged, productive, and satisfied team.\\n\\n“I’m using EXI to understand where the problems are across my organization. Do we have problems in Sales that don't manifest themselves in Marketing? Do we have remote employees struggling with problems that in-office employees don't have right now? I'm blind to those things. EXI will help us better focus our resources to where they're needed — now.”\\n\\n— Chuck Adkins, SVP, Information Technology, Intercontinental Exchange\\n\\nHow to improve your employee experience KPIs\\n\\nIn today's competitive business landscape, staying informed about industry benchmarks can be crucial to making strategic decisions that bring growth and success. But traditional analytics solutions may only provide benchmarks relative to your past performance, which isn't always enough for a comprehensive comparative analysis.\\n\\nFigure 4: By analyzing both industry and company size benchmarks with EXI, you can compare your business' performance against a broader range of companies similar to yours.\\n\\nHowever, Moveworks' data from over 250 customers offers a more holistic perspective, allowing you to set informed, targeted goals and remain agile in a constantly evolving market. By analyzing both industry and company size benchmarks with EXI, you can compare your business' performance against a broader range of companies similar to yours. These benchmarks are regularly refreshed and hold the key to refining your strategies to meet industry standards and stay ahead of your competitors.\\n\\nAnd the automatic updates provided by Moveworks save you countless hours of sifting through reports, ensuring that you have the most current data at your fingertips. Leveraging Moveworks' extensive customer base data empowers you to make well-informed decisions, set ambitious yet realistic goals, and maintain a competitive edge within your industry.\\n\\n“When you look at data in a traditional ITSM, you’re looking at pure ticket metadata, but that’s ignoring the actual language of the tickets itself. EXI makes sense of the raw data, offering a whole new perspective. We finally have the answers to help us focus.”\\n\\n— Gerhard Nel, Senior Global Services Director, Albemarle\\n\\nThe future of EXI\\n\\nThe traditional ways of measuring employee experience are no longer sufficient. But thankfully, the power of AI presents an innovative solution to uplevel the process.\\n\\nWe've just explored how EXI can effectively supercharge strategic enterprise initiatives and breathe new life into your employee experience. But our journey doesn't end here! There's much more on our roadmap, and we're excited to introduce developments in the future. Here's a glimpse of what's in store:\\n\\nProactive insights with generative AI: EXI is poised to transform employee experience measurement by creating models that will derive actionable insights autonomously, making the whole process more streamlined and efficient. We'll soon provide proactive insights that help you identify potential roadblocks and challenges before they escalate, ensuring that you stay ahead of the curve and make more pertinent, timely decisions for continuous improvement.\\n\\nCustomized reports: No two organizations are the same, and neither should be their employee experience analyses. Our upcoming customized report feature will enable you to tailor the data for your unique business requirements and goals, meaning your insights will be more targeted and effective.\\n\\nAdditional data sources: By expanding the scope of EXI’s data sources, organizations will gain a deeper understanding of their work environment, enabling targeted strategies to improve efficiency throughout the entire enterprise by tapping into diverse data sources and driving actionable insights.\\n\\nThe transformation of employee experience measurement is not only a nice-to-have but a business imperative, and AI is the key.

You’re in charge of solving big problems across your organization, and you need to create impact fast. That said, challenging the status quo is hard. And it’s even harder when you’re not yet embedded in your organization.\\n\\nWhenever I consider this challenge, I am immediately drawn to Yousuf Khan. Currently a Partner at Ridge Ventures, Yousuf has over two decades of experience as CIO. He's mastered what it takes to lead an IT organization, and given his extensive experience advising new leaders, he’s uniquely qualified to offer a perspective on how to succeed.\\n\\nRecently, I had the great privilege to sit down with Yousuf. In the conversation below, you’re not going to find specific metrics to care about or specific tools to invest in. That’s not what’s most important.\\n\\nWhat’s most important for anyone stepping into a C-level role is the ability to make the move from functional expert to leader and executive. Yousuf and I both know from experience that this transition involves a massive mindset shift. And that’s why I’m excited to share these insights with you. Let’s dive right in.\\n\\nBhavin: It can’t be easy to step into an important job like CIO and just know what’s going on from go. What’s the fastest way to get a complete view of your organization?\\n\\nYousuf: Ask questions and listen. From day one, you need to kick off a continuous top-down review of your organization. That starts with your own onboarding. Since you’re new to the organization, you have all the benefits of being an outsider. Ask yourself, “Are new employees having a great experience with IT during the first week?”\\n\\nSo put yourself in the shoes of the tens, hundreds, thousands of employees who’ve gone through the same experience. Then, look for room for improvement. Ask the obvious questions of yourself, your team, and other teams. What’s working? What isn’t working? Why did we not mention this new initiative?\\n\\nIt’s important to use your common sense. Dig into the ticket queue to understand the pulse of the IT organization: What frustrates people? What do they care about? Why are 50% of tickets about Salesforce? As you get closer to the everyday issues, you’ll get a clearer picture of what’s actually going on. It doesn’t take much to see the patterns and where the problems are.\\n\\nIt’s just as important to engage with your fellow executives and figure out what the perception of IT is, as it is to identify the specific issues that are causing trouble.\\n\\nPerception is the operable word. An employee’s viewpoint is steeped in their reality. And in my experience, there’s a pretty consistent gap between what IT can do, change, and enable versus what people think IT can do, change, and enable.\\n\\nWhy not aim to sit in another executive leader’s all-hands meeting to hear if anything that relates to issues with systems or data. These are not just their problems. These problems are your problems.\\n\\nArmed with feedback from these conversations, you can better position your vision for the future of the IT function and prioritize the initiatives that will transform the way your new organization perceives your role and your team’s role.\\n\\nThe last thing I’ll mention is this: You need to lean into your experience as an IT leader. You don't have to have some internal reference point to assess what's working and what isn't. Use your experience to question the status quo if something looks off.\\n\\nBhavin: I know from past conversations with you, as well as my own experience, that it’s important for every new leader to have a vision. But, new leaders also have a lot on their plate. How do you prioritize which initiatives to tackle first?\\n\\nYousuf: First off — having a vision for the future is hugely important for any new CIO. But you also need to understand that priorities are constantly changing because business environments are constantly changing.\\n\\nTo look at an example, two years ago, the number one priority was enabling remote work. You better have Slack or Teams, and you better teach your employees to properly use Slack or Teams, or you’re going to fall behind. Now, the priority is budget optimization and automation because, hey, guess what? The economy's in a bit of a downturn. So regardless of that original vision — certain initiatives aren’t going to happen.\\n\\nWhen you have to decide where to focus your energy, personally, I recommend a prioritization matrix. On one axis is priority (how much is this initiative going to move the needle?), and on the other is complexity (how many resources will be required to enact this initiative?).\\n\\nBy mapping different initiatives on this matrix, I’m better able to visualize the trade-offs. Maybe I have one big, high-priority initiative, but it will take a lot of time and energy to get it done. Does that mean I sacrifice three smaller, low-priority projects to be able to do it? In the end, what matters is focusing on what will bring me the biggest win.\\n\\nFigure 1:\\xa0 Good decision-making is all about understanding the trade-offs between priority and complexity.\\n\\nAll that said, prioritization is something that is best done collectively. Given that priorities shift on a regular basis, the best CIOs, in my viewpoint, are the ones who prioritize in partnership with their executive team. Working with other executives not only gives you an opportunity to communicate your vision, it also lets you triangulate with other teams’ goals and work towards a common purpose.\\n\\nThe point is — CIOs have to fix everyone else’s problems. Solid internal partnerships can give you access to information that makes it seem like you can see around corners because you know what’s affecting each business division, and you’re working to fix those problems proactively.\\n\\nKnowing what each team’s biggest pain points are means that you suddenly have the tools you need to solve the problem. Are salespeople complaining about how complex Salesforce is? Are engineers waiting too long for hardware? Are investors concerned about profitability? Knowing what’s challenging other company leaders allows you to properly prioritize solutions and be proactive about solving them.\\n\\nA simple “Let me fix that problem for you” can go a long way.\\n\\nBhavin: How do you measure success? Is there a framework that you recommend?\\n\\nYousuf: So — no. There’s no one-size-fits-all approach to benchmarking. Measuring success involves a lot of intuition and practice. It’s tough because the shape and strategy and philosophy of every company are different. And as a result of that, IT operations are kind of all over the map, which is why I say that quantifying success is more about intuition and your experience as an IT leader. Of course, there are some quantitative measures to take into account, but these represent operational improvements, not the results of a strategic change in the short term.\\n\\nAnd that's why being part of a CIO community is very important. If you’re a new CIO, meeting and engaging with other CIOs in your network will offer you a leg up. Other leaders can offer a different vantage point and call out things you should look out for.\\n\\nYou’ll learn more from failure and mistakes than from success. Work to learn from other CIOs on a regular basis.\\n\\nFigure 2: Success sits at the intersection of your ability to provide a high-quality employee experience and run efficient IT operations. The greater the overlap, the greater your success.\\n\\nAll that said, I’ll share my perspective: Measure success by your ability to address pain points efficiently. If a certain process is taking long, is frustrating, or is wasting resources, it shows up. It shows up in meetings. It shows up when you want to get things done.\\n\\nThat’s when it’s time for you to start asking questions: What process is causing the pain? How can we iterate? Can we automate? Does the process need to be removed? Make the necessary changes and revisit the initial pain point. Did you solve the problem? Yes? Well, that’s success.\\n\\nBhavin: You briefly mentioned automation. CIOs — and technology leaders in general — talk a lot about automation and leveraging AI to solve problems. It’s becoming a key part of everyday business operations. How do you decide where automation can play an important role?\\n\\nYousuf: CIOs, IT leaders — we’re geeks. We like to solve problems with technology and automation. We’re always looking for the next opportunity. Mainly, it takes a lot of pure observation and analysis.\\n\\nTo back up a bit, one of the key anchors for a CIO role is to drive employee productivity. And a big part of increasing productivity is building a great experience and ensuring that every employee can easily get what they need to get their job done.\\n\\nWhen I’m looking to deploy automation or AI, for me, it's a very binary decision. I figure out which processes are manual, cumbersome, and repetitive. Then, I look for ways to automate. And hopefully, automate in a way that doesn’t just create more work for everyone.\\n\\nTo go back to the prioritization matrix I mentioned earlier, sometimes CIOs get fixated on solving a problem that helps their twenty or so agents be more efficient. And that’s great! But it’s also important for CIOs to more often look for opportunities to make all employees or a particular department more productive instead.\\n\\nAutomation has a role to play on both sides of the service desk. Because, again, perception matters. By improving the operations of not just your own team but the company as a whole, you’ll make a big impression on other company leaders and how they understand IT’s function.\\n\\nI mean, if something, anything is taking an exorbitant amount of time and resources, then you're asking yourself why. Is there anything I can change to speed up the process? Is there a technology I can use? Is there a vendor other CIOs are using successfully?\\n\\nSo, to sum it up: Automation, obviously, can play a massive role in your IT operations. The key is finding the most practical and the most impactful use cases within your organization. And to do that, it goes back to your first question. You constantly have to pay attention, looking for what’s working and what’s not.\\n\\nBhavin: We’ve covered a lot of ground so far, and something that keeps coming up is how important it is for IT leaders to form relationships with other executives. What advice can you give to new CIOs looking to quickly get a seat at the table?\\n\\nYousuf: To start — not all C-level executives are on the same footing. The CIO’s role evolved only recently. It’s not just about “keeping the lights on” anymore. CIOs have to be ready to work alongside CEOs and other C-level executives.\\n\\nTo build good partnerships among the executive team, you’ve got to be excellent at communication. You’ve got to be excellent at communicating within your team, across the company, and with the executive team.\\n\\nBe very clear about your roadmap and your vision for the company from day one. Then continue to communicate that plan on a forward basis. The CIO role might just be the most cross-functional position in every company. So really, to be successful, you’ve got to communicate effectively.\\n\\nThe other piece of getting a seat at the table is by defining yourself as a leader. The “table” is for leaders, so you have to be a leader to get a seat at the table.\\n\\nYou can be a very, very good manager. You can do that really well. But if you're not a leader capable of making hard decisions, enabling people, and executing change across your company — you’re not going to get that seat. It’s fair to say that as a new CIO, you can do everything I’ve suggested so far, but if you don't have the ear of the CEO and other execs, you won't be able to realize your vision.\\n\\nAnd to wrap up my answer here, the number one thing you can do is to be an active part of the CIO community. You’ll be able to learn more from your peers’ experiences and strategies than anything I could say in a single interview.\\n\\nBhavin: Speaking of picking the brains of the CIO community — one last question: Is there anything you learned the hard way in your career that you wish someone had told you?\\n\\nYousuf: Oh, 100%. Feedback. I never got enough feedback. And as a result, I wasn’t able to develop my career as much or as fast as I would have wanted. If I could turn back the clock, I’d make sure that when I became a CIO, I’d make sure that I got plenty of feedback and was consistent about doing that early, both informally and formally. Feedback gives you an amazing opportunity for character building — and to show that you’re interested and capable of improving yourself.\\n\\nFigure 3: Continuous feedback helps you and your team to develop the skills needed to succeed.\\n\\nGiving feedback is just as important as getting it. You’ve got to connect with your team. Your team’s morale and motivation hinge on your ability to think about and demonstrate an interest in your people’s careers. And your success as CIO hinges on your team’s ability to perform. So give your team the information and the support they need to be their best.\\n\\nCIOs, if you only read one thing, read this:\\n\\nLet’s be honest. If you’re a new CIO, you don’t have a lot of time. So here’s the TLDR.\\n\\nIt should go without saying: Today’s CIO jobs are big, complex roles. To succeed, new IT leaders will have to make their mark fast.\\n\\nThat’s why I think this conversation with Yousuf is incredibly valuable for any IT professional looking for an edge. Given his wide variety of experience, Yousuf’s able to offer a uniquely insightful perspective on what it takes to “crush it” as a new CIO. He’s seen firsthand how the massive disruption of the past few years has led to a unique moment for leaders, and businesses cannot afford to allow leadership to only focus on just one part of the business.\\n\\nBefore I sign off, let's revisit four core themes from this conversation:\\n\\nAsk questions. You can only solve your company’s biggest, most impactful problems when you know what’s holding your team, your fellow leaders, and your company back. So ask questions from day one.\\n\\nCommunicate effectively. How you communicate with others affects the way they perceive you, your role, and your ability to impact your company's future.\\n\\nBuild relationships. Even the best leaders can’t tackle their company’s biggest challenges solo. Rely on a supportive peer group and lean on your team. And remember, the leaders with the greatest influence and legacy are those who work together and empower others.\\n\\nAdopt a growth mindset. All feedback is good feedback. Listen actively, take the time to understand, and then embrace challenges as opportunities to improve yourself. With this approach, you won’t be a new CIO for long — you’ll be a great leader.\\n\\nKnow exactly what’s slowing your people down with\\xa0Employee Experience Insights.\\n\\nSign up for a\\xa0demo\\xa0today to see it in action.\\n\\nbest practices\\n\\ntechnology\\n\\nMore blog posts\\n\\nHow to unlock continual service improvement with AIOps\\n      \\n        \\n          Discover how AIOps transforms IT operations from reactive to proactive.

But with great power comes great responsibility — and one of the biggest responsibilities is protecting users from security and privacy risks.\\n\\nThanks to advancements in conversational AI, like ChatGPT, creating sophisticated and natural-sounding chatbots has become easier than ever before. However, these advancements also come with essential questions around trust and responsibility.\\n\\nToday, we'll discuss strategies for using this powerful technology in a way that prioritizes security and privacy, and responsible AI.\\n\\nThis post will answer the following questions:\\n\\nWhat is enterprise-grade conversational AI?\\n\\nWhat are the fundamental elements of a trustworthy, enterprise-grade conversational AI?\\n\\nWhy are security and privacy crucial to trustworthiness?\\n\\nWhether you're a seasoned AI expert or new to the field, this guide is designed to help you navigate the fast-moving world of conversational AI and make informed decisions when choosing a solution.\\n\\nWhat is enterprise-grade conversational AI?\\n\\nConversational AI is the technology that allows machines to hold natural language conversations with users. For example, ChatGPT uses conversational AI to answer questions, hold discussions on a wide range of topics, and generate text based on prompts given to it by users.\\n\\nLayering on top of\\n\\nlarge language models that power general conversational AI, like ChatGPT, enterprise-grade conversational AI often integrates with enterprise collaboration platforms, like Slack or Microsoft Teams, and popular enterprise portals, like Workday and ServiceNow, to surface the best information. Additionally,\\n\\nenterprise-grade\\n\\nconversational AI has been fine-tuned with additional domain- and enterprise-specific data to accurately respond to user queries with relevant results.\\n\\nTo offer a comparison: If you go to ChatGPT and ask it to add you to a sales distribution list, it won’t work. On the other hand, an enterprise-grade conversational AI like Moveworks would use the information at its disposal to know who you are, what your role is, and which distribution list you’re referring to. Then, it would interface with the relevant systems and add you to that list in moments.\\n\\nAs you can probably imagine, getting accurate and actionable responses like the example above requires gathering data from different systems in a company’s environment. As enterprise-grade conversational AI is often used in sensitive and business-critical situations that might involve employee data, financial transactions, or other critical operations, it’s unsurprising that security and privacy are paramount. And that begs the question: What makes conversational AI trustworthy?\\n\\nWhat are the fundamentals of chatbot security?\\n\\nWhen deploying conversational AI in an enterprise setting, there's more to consider than just the technology itself.\\n\\nBuilding trust into conversational AI means implementing proper data privacy protections throughout the platform to ensure that customers’ information remains secure. To make sure your conversational AI is trustworthy, you should consider eight fundamental elements as described below.\\n\\nFigure 1:\\xa0Conversational AI platform overview detailing eight fundamentals of conversational AI trustworthiness.\\n\\n1. Customer Trust\\n\\nA conversational AI vendor should consider building customer trust by establishing and maintaining information security and privacy processes and mechanisms. This requires an explicit commitment from the executive leadership to continuously invest in such key initiatives in a timely manner. Ultimately, the vendor's goal should be to ensure that customers feel confident sharing their data.\\n\\nSome questions to keep in mind:\\n\\nIs there a dedicated security team?\\n\\nWho is the CISO?\\n\\nWhat is the subject matter expertise of the security team?\\n\\nWhat formal security and privacy processes exist to safeguard data?\\n\\nIs there an executive commitment to security and privacy efforts?\\n\\nWhat in-built security and privacy features does the product have to offer?\\n\\n2. Identity and Input Validation\\n\\nYou should ensure that the information exchanged between the bot and your environment is properly validated and that user identity is safeguarded. The conversational AI’s infrastructure should also be properly configured with secure defaults in place.\\n\\nSome questions to keep in mind:\\n\\nHow are users’ identities validated?\\n\\nHow does the bot ensure that the information can only be accessed by the right users?\\n\\nWhat validation exists for untrusted user input?\\n\\n3. Access Control\\n\\nIn the context of conversational AI, proper access controls are key to ensuring that AI is making the information accessible to individuals who are authorized to access it. Moreover, the vendor should store customer data separately with permissions in place to ensure it is only authorized to users who absolutely need it.\\n\\nSome questions to keep in mind:\\n\\nWhat type of data does the AI have access to?\\n\\nHow does the vendor limit access to your data?\\n\\nWhat permissions are in place?\\n\\nHow is your data securely stored?\\n\\nHow are access controls reviewed?\\n\\n4. Hardened Infrastructure\\n\\nHardened infrastructure is crucial for a secure conversational AI platform. It dramatically reduces the risk of cyber attacks by eliminating common vulnerabilities that malicious actors could exploit. Implementing robust security measures and then regularly assessing and updating them is imperative to ensure resilience against threats.\\n\\nSome questions to keep in mind:\\n\\nWhere is the customer data hosted, and how is it safeguarded?\\n\\nWhat processes and mechanisms are implemented to ensure your infrastructure is properly configured?\\n\\nWhat monitoring, alerting, detecting, and auditing tools are in place to identify potential threats to your infrastructure?\\n\\nWhat evaluations are performed against the infrastructure, and on what cadence?\\n\\n5. Data Handling\\n\\nConversational AI in an enterprise needs to access and process data to service requests and generate user-specific responses. Therefore, to successfully deploy a conversational AI, it is crucial to consider how it accesses and processes data to provide accurate and personalized responses. A reliable conversational AI should utilize machine learning (ML) to improve over time, requiring proper privacy-enhancing technologies to safeguard customer data.\\n\\nSome questions to keep in mind:\\n\\nHow is customer data securely handled in transit and at rest?\\n\\nWhat capabilities does the vendor have to delete data?\\n\\nWhat machine learning capabilities exist to properly safeguard data?\\n\\nHow is customer data used for training the ML models?\\n\\n6. Data Masking\\n\\nIn an enterprise environment, conversational AI should be capable of handling sensitive data to serve various use cases. However, users may inadvertently enter sensitive data that is not necessary for the conversational AI to do its job. Therefore, it is important to mask such sensitive data from being exposed.\\n\\nData masking ensures that sensitive customer data is concealed from people who might need to review or access data as part of their job, such as data annotators. A trustworthy conversational AI has this functionality to ensure that sensitive data is not exposed.\\n\\nSome questions to keep in mind:\\n\\nWhat data masking capabilities are in place?\\n\\n7. Industry Certification\\n\\nOne way to ensure that a conversational AI vendor is taking the necessary precautions is to see if they’ve obtained industry certifications and adhered to recognized security standards. These certifications demonstrate a commitment to safeguarding customer data and ensure that baseline security controls are in place to protect against potential breaches. The vendor should demonstrate its commitment to going above and beyond industry certifications.\\n\\nSome questions to keep in mind:\\n\\nWhat security and privacy certification does the vendor have?\\n\\nDoes the vendor go above and beyond certifications?\\n\\nHow does the vendor think and care about security and privacy?\\n\\n8. Responsible AI\\n\\nEnsuring minimal bias in the development of ML models is a crucial factor in establishing trust in a conversational AI. Responsible AI practice involves ML developers ensuring that patterns learned from data do not perpetuate implicit or explicit biases. Anonymizing data, tuning models for fairness, and conducting bias-detection evaluations can show a vendor’s commitment to building a responsible AI, securing the platform while promoting fairness.\\n\\nSome questions to keep in mind:\\n\\nHow does the vendor evaluate and mitigate possible bias in their ML models?\\n\\nDoes the vendor perform any fairness-focused model tuning?\\n\\nEnsuring chatbot security for the enterprise\\n\\nWhen it comes to conversational AI, C-level decision-makers face big decisions with enormous consequences. It's crucial to approach any AI development and deployment with responsibility and caution as more and more industries adopt these solutions.\\n\\nAt Moveworks, we've seen this technology's benefits firsthand, and we also recognize the importance of implementing robust security and privacy measures and ensuring unbiased machine learning models.\\n\\nBy taking a thoughtful and informed approach to conversational AI that includes the fundamentals above, businesses can harness its power while protecting their users and promoting secure and responsible AI practices.\\n\\nMoveworks prioritizes trustworthy conversational AI\\n\\nFrom day one, Moveworks has been committed to ensuring the proper safeguarding of sensitive data in conversational AI.

Servers are down, networks are congested, and your team is scrambling to prevent a total meltdown. You spend the day fighting fires without any time to understand why these issues keep happening. Just when you think you've got things under control, another avalanche of alerts arrives to start the cycle all over again.\\n\\nIf this stressful game of Whac-A-Mole resonates with you, you’re not alone. Modern IT environments have become extremely complex and chaotic. Most IT teams remain stuck in reactive mode, lurching from one crisis to another. But what if there was a better way? What if you could detect anomalies before they escalate into major incidents? Or if your systems could self-tune and optimize without constant human intervention? That’s exactly what AIOps aims to accomplish.\\n\\nAIOps, or artificial intelligence for IT operations, is the advanced usage of analytics and machine learning to help IT teams transition from reactive to proactive. It’s like having a data scientist monitoring your systems 24/7 and providing constant performance tuning in the background. Rather than simply reacting to problems, AIOps enables you to get ahead of issues before they even start. It’s a game-changer for maximizing availability and efficiency.\\n\\nIn this post, we’ll explore:\\n\\nWhat AIOps entails\\n\\nWhy you need AIOps\\n\\nThe key benefits of AIOps\\n\\nThe core components of AIOps\\n\\nAIOps use cases and applications\\n\\nBest practices for launching AIOps\\n\\nAn AIOps solution for modern IT operations\\n\\nWhat is AIOps?\\n\\nAIOps originated from Gartner as an industry category and stands for Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations. It refers to advanced platforms that combine big data and machine learning to automate and enhance IT operations and workflows. The core goal of AIOps is to enable continuous improvement and optimization of IT systems and processes.\\n\\nAt its foundation, AIOps ingests data from various IT monitoring tools and applies analytics and AI algorithms to detect patterns and surface insights. This allows AIOps platforms to correlate events across disparate systems, identify root causes, and even predict potential issues before they occur.\\n\\nKey capabilities of AIOps include:\\n\\nNoise reduction and pattern recognition: Identifying meaningful signals amidst data noise.\\n\\nIntelligent alerting: Eliminating notification fatigue by sending alerts only for critical events.\\n\\nDynamic baselining: Adjusting normal thresholds automatically based on seasonal changes.\\n\\nCausal analysis: Mapping incidents and events to determine root cause\\n\\nPredictive analytics: Forecasting trends to manage future capacity requirements.\\n\\nThe overarching value of AIOps is enabling IT teams to shift from reactive firefighting to continuous optimization and improvement. By applying AI to monitor systems, detect patterns, and surface insights, AIOps platforms can help transform IT operations.\\n\\nTraditional IT operations are stuck in a reactive loop\\n\\nWithout AIOps, many IT Ops teams can be stuck in a reactive rut. Their days can often involve a constant stream of fire drills triggered by alerts and incidents. Despite any heroic efforts, resolving issues can take far too long due to reliance on outdated tools and manual processes.\\n\\nA typical incident response workflow might go something like this:\\n\\nAn alert fires about a system or application malfunction. The on-call engineer scrambles to investigate.\\n\\nThey spend hours trying to connect insights from disparate monitoring tools. Logs are searched manually for clues.\\n\\nAfter triaging the issue, they engage the app owners and dev teams to resolve the problem. Details get lost in lengthy email threads and meetings.\\n\\nA temporary fix is deployed to restore service. But the root cause stays unclear, making recurrence likely.\\n\\nThe incident report sits in a queue for days before the engineer gets time to document it. No lessons learned are captured to prevent similar issues.\\n\\nLeadership is frustrated by the repeated outages disrupting business. Employees complain about the poor experience.\\n\\nOverwhelmed IT teams work nights and weekends, but problems keep arising. Burnout sets in.\\n\\nThis reactive model resulted from the growing complexity of modern tech stacks coupled with a lack of AI-driven process automation. No amount of hiring can help ops teams keep pace with the deluge of data and the constant need for system optimization. With only 23% of IT leaders saying that their current strategy allows them to keep pace with the demands of modern business —\\xa0 the solution to this challenge lies in technology evolution.\\n\\nWhy you need AIOps\\n\\nThe technological landscape has changed dramatically over the past decade, making traditional manual IT operations analytics inadequate to handle the scale, complexity, and speed demanded by modern businesses.\\n\\nSome of the key drivers behind the growing need for AIOps are:\\n\\nExpanding IT environments: The adoption of cloud, containers, microservices, and other technologies has exploded the scope and scale of IT infrastructure. The variety of components and their interconnectedness have outpaced the capability for manual monitoring and management.\\n\\nExponential data growth: Systems and applications are producing immense volumes of machine data. Traditional tools cannot effectively analyze massive amounts of unstructured data to identify meaningful patterns and insights. Advanced AI is required to process and interpret this flood of data.\\n\\nIncreasing need for faster problem resolution: In today's fast-paced digital world, businesses cannot afford prolonged IT outages or performance issues. The IT costs of downtime and technical debt continue to rise. AIOps enables rapid anomaly detection and root cause analysis to accelerate problem diagnosis and repair.\\n\\nMore computing at the network edge: With cloud, IoT, and mobile, computing power and critical systems are moving to the edge. IT teams lack visibility and control over these fragmented environments using legacy tools. AIOps provides holistic observability across the decentralized stack.\\n\\nDeveloper empowerment: Developers are rightly empowered to release code quickly, but they are not always held accountable for performance in production. AIOps help enforce SLAs and optimize systems even as the app stack rapidly changes.\\n\\nAs business demands on IT continue accelerating, AIOps have become an imperative to tame the complexity and keep systems humming. Applying AI to analyze data, identify insights, and recommend actions is the only scalable way to maintain continuous improvement. AIOps enables sustainable IT operations.\\n\\nKey benefits of AIOps\\n\\nOrganizations that implement AIOps realize a range of powerful benefits that positively impact IT operations and the broader business:\\n\\nIncreased efficiency: AIOps automates manual tasks, enforces best practices, and provides continuous system tuning, boosting productivity and efficiency for IT teams.\\n\\nReduced downtime: Outages and performance issues are rapidly detected and remediated before causing user impact, and as a result, mean time to resolution shrinks dramatically.\\n\\nLower costs: With fewer fire drills and human-driven processes, overhead and infrastructure expenses are optimized. Teams can focus on innovation rather than maintenance.\\n\\nGreater agility: Faster incident response and streamlined change management enable more frequent, seamless releases.\\n\\nProactive optimization: Instead of reactive approaches, systems are continually tuned based on AI-detected signals and patterns, preventing issues before they happen.\\n\\nEnhanced experiences: By headlining off customer- and employee-impacting failures and performance problems, AIOps maintains consistently high digital experience.\\n\\nLeading organizations across industries like Luminis Health, Intercontinental Exchange, and Albemarle have adopted AIOps to transform IT operations. These companies have sped up support, lowered mean time to repair, and rapidly identified major workplace disruptions by investing in AIOps.\\n\\nTheir success stories prove that AIOps delivers game-changing benefits. This AI-powered approach enables support teams to finally break free of reactive work and shift their focus to continuous improvement and innovation. The result is ultra-reliable, high-performance IT that drives business growth.\\n\\nCore components of AIOps\\n\\nAIOps platforms leverage a combination of technologies to enable continuous intelligence and automation for IT operations. Here are the key capabilities:\\n\\nData collection and analysis\\n\\nMulti-layered data collection: AIOps ingests monitoring data from across the technology stack to fuel deeper insights. This includes infrastructure metrics, application logs, business KPIs, tracing data, customer engagement signals, and more.\\n\\nFlexible data ingestion: Custom connectors and streaming pipelines allow the ingestion of diverse data formats from both legacy and modern systems, breaking down data silos and enriching AIOps analytics.\\n\\nPowerful data processing: At its core, AIOps relies on scalable big data infrastructure for storing, processing, and querying vast volumes of machine data in real time to unlock speed and depth of analysis.\\n\\nAutomated detection and triage\\n\\nAdvanced machine learning: AIOps applies ML techniques like clustering, classification, regression, and reinforcement learning to detect anomalies, forecast issues, prescribe actions, and optimize configurations.\\n\\nIntelligent alerting: Beyond static thresholds, adaptive algorithms determine the right alerting criteria based on severity, frequency, and other dimensions to reduce alert fatigue.\\n\\nCausal analysis: AIOps analyzes event sequences and patterns to build dependency maps automatically, accelerating root cause identification during incidents.\\n\\nAutomated triage: AIOps can automatically prioritize and route alerts to the appropriate teams based on criticality, service impact, and other factors.\\n\\nAutomated response and remediation\\n\\nPrescriptive actions: The platform can take intelligent actions like auto-remediations, forecast capacity needs, tune configurations, and more based on insights from the data. Humans focus on higher-order problems.\\n\\nIntelligent runbook automation: AIOps can trigger automated playbooks and runbooks based on identified issues to accelerate recovery.\\n\\nSelf-healing capabilities: For known issues with prescribed fixes, AIOps can automatically remediate without human intervention.\\n\\nContinuous learning\\n\\nContinuous baseline learning: The system continually adjusts baselines for metrics based on periodicity, trends, and past incidents to minimize false alerts, dynamically adapting to new norms.\\n\\nFeedback loops: AIOps platforms utilize feedback loops to continuously improve anomaly detection, forecasting, and remediation recommendations.\\n\\nTransfer learning: Models can leverage learnings from past issues and solutions to accelerate the handling of new incidents.\\n\\nTogether, these capabilities allow AIOps to apply AI/ML to continuously analyze IT data, identify optimization opportunities, and take actions that drive intelligent decision-making. The result is a self-optimizing IT operations engine.\\n\\nAIOps use cases and applications\\n\\nAIOps platforms have diverse applications across IT operations, empowering teams to optimize systems proactively. Here are some common use cases:\\n\\nIntelligent alerting: Suppress noise and prioritize alerts that require human intervention based on severity and impact.\\n\\nAnomaly detection: Identify abnormalities in metrics, logs, and traces to detect failures, security threats, and capacity issues.\\n\\nIncident diagnosis: Analyze event data leading up to an incident to rapidly isolate the root cause.\\n\\nCapacity forecasting: Predict infrastructure needs and optimize capacity based on growth trends.\\n\\nPerformance optimization: Continually tune configurations, resource allocation, and code paths to improve speed and throughput.\\n\\nAutomated remediation: Execute predefined actions like restarting processes, scaling resources, and recovering nodes upon detecting issues.\\n\\nChange analysis: Evaluate performance impacts of changes to code, configurations, and architecture.\\n\\nCloud cost optimization: Rightsize workloads across cloud environments and recommend architectures based on utilization patterns.\\n\\nAdditionally, AIOps delivers value across many verticals:\\n\\nE-commerce: Maintain ultra-reliable storefronts with minimum downtime during peak traffic.\\n\\nFinance: Flag anomalous transactions and predict cybersecurity threats.\\n\\nHealthcare: Optimize EHR systems and ensure HIPAA compliance.\\n\\nManufacturing: Predict equipment failures based on IoT sensor data.\\n\\nAdvanced AIOps platforms can analyze your support tickets so you know exactly what’s slowing down your teams in real time. These platforms can look at your unstructured data and visualize the most important problems slowing down your organization so you can fully see the experiences behind your services. You can even filter the data by individual departments and time periods. Companies like Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) leverage these advanced AIOps platforms to prioritize and address issues that are reducing productivity in their workforce.\\n\\nSimply put, the applications are endless. AIOps enables proactive optimization by continually tuning systems based on AI-detected signals rather than reacting to problems. This drives major improvements in service reliability, efficiency, and cost.\\n\\nChallenges and considerations for AIOps\\n\\nWhile AIOps promises significant benefits, there are also important challenges and considerations when adopting these platforms:\\n\\nData quality: Insufficient or poor quality data limits the effectiveness of AIOps analytics. Data gaps need to be identified and monitoring coverage expanded.\\n\\nData silos: Consolidating datasets from disparate systems and tools requires upfront integration work.\\n\\nModel accuracy: If algorithms are trained on biased or inadequate data, they will make unreliable recommendations.\\n\\nOrganizational resistance: Due to a lack of skills or trust in AI, teams may not act on AIOps insights. User education and coaching is key.\\n\\nWorkload overhead: Running AIOps places additional data and compute demands on infrastructure.\\n\\nMaintaining continuity: The AIOps platform itself needs monitoring and failover mechanisms to avoid becoming a single point of failure.\\n\\nIterative adoption: While the vision is autonomous operations, it is unwise to turn over the keys to AIOps all at once. A gradual, iterative approach is recommended.\\n\\nWith careful planning and execution, these hurdles can be overcome. The key is to start with limited use cases and feed the AIOps platform higher-quality data over time. AIOps capabilities will compound as the system learns more about the IT environment. The journey requires patience but pays continuous dividends.\\n\\nBest practices for launching AIOps\\n\\nImplementing AIOps to achieve continuous optimization requires careful planning and execution. Here are some best practices:\\n\\nExecutive sponsorship: Get buy-in from leadership on the vision and resources required to support AIOps.\\n\\nCross-team collaboration: Break down silos between ITOps, DevOps, and data teams and align on goals.\\n\\nPhased rollout: Start with a limited use case and dataset, and only then expand the scope gradually as the platform matures.\\n\\nData governance: Establish processes for data quality, tagging, security, and compliance early on.\\n\\nMonitor continuous data flows: Ensure AIOps is ingesting a constant stream of data from across environments to enable continuous optimization.\\n\\nIterative model tuning: Measure AIOps accuracy KPIs like false positives. To prevent these issues, ensure that models are retrained regularly to improve the reliability of insights.\\n\\nEnable closed-loop actions: Build playbooks for auto-remediations once AIOps recommendations prove reliable.\\n\\nMaintain talent mix: Have data scientists oversee AIOps ML pipelines even as automation displaces some routine IT tasks and upskill staff where possible.\\n\\nReview outcomes periodically: Establish governance to evaluate AIOps effectiveness, user adoption, and ROI.\\n\\nWith an iterative, collaborative approach, AIOps can transform IT operations. But rushing into automation without the right foundations risks undermining both AIOps and cultural adoption. Patience and sustained commitment to improvement is key.\\n\\nWelcome to the future of intelligence IT operations\\n\\nAIOps represent a seismic shift for IT teams bogged down in manual drudgery. By applying advanced analytics and machine learning, AIOps enable the long-sought vision of self-driving, self-optimizing IT infrastructure.\\n\\nThis is not some far-off fantasy. Companies are already slashing incident resolution times. Outages are prevented before users even notice. And systems tune themselves so agents can focus on innovation.\\n\\nThe rise of cloud-native technologies like containers and microservices will only accelerate the need for intelligent automation. Manual solutions simply cannot keep pace with the complexity.\\n\\nA whopping 85% of leaders whose companies enjoy fully accessible data say the organization can embrace change readily. With a commitment to continuous improvement and fully accessible data, AIOps will unlock unprecedented scale and reliability.\\n\\nLong gone are the days when fire drills reduced forward progress to a standstill, and your best and brightest are bogged down addressing these issues.

Make an immediate impact.\\n\\nVarun Singh, VP of Product\\n\\nAugust 4, 2022\\n\\nlinkedin\\n\\nfacebook\\n\\ntwitter\\n\\nemail\\n\\nHR leaders, you already know the stakes are high. Hybrid work is fast becoming commonplace. Burnout is rampant. The pandemic is ongoing. There’s no way to know what will disrupt business as usual next.\\n\\nNow is not the time to focus on abstract company culture. Instead — with this much uncertainty — it's critical to quantify your impact on the bottom line. That’s why top HR leaders are so focused on their most impactful job: keeping employees productive.\\n\\nTo help employees be their best, the most forward-thinking HR teams in the world are turning to conversational AI. With AI, employees receive world-class support in seconds, and their HR teams can focus on what matters most — helping people, not muddling through support queues.\\n\\nTeams at CommScope and Palo Alto Networks are using this technology now to speed up support, saving their people time and their companies money. Today, I’ll walk you through a fraction of the ways these HR teams use AI to efficiently support their employees.\\n\\nAI answers HR questions\\n\\nHR can create a wonderfully positive and happy work environment — but only if they’re not constantly dealing with time-consuming, routine issues. Conversational AI can step in, answering questions in seconds and sending relevant information proactively.\\n\\nOnboarding employees at scale\\n\\nNew hires have dozens of important things to do. By sending onboarding materials via a conversational chatbot, employees can start their jobs right — with the ability to prioritize top-of-mind questions on day one.\\n\\nSurface company holiday schedules\\n\\nEspecially in a hybrid world, keeping track of where employees work can be a massive undertaking. With a deeply integrated conversational AI strategy, HR teams can offer up a personalized holiday schedule depending on where employees are located.\\n\\nTroubleshoot tax situations\\n\\nTaxes can cause complex — but familiar — problems for employees. AI can surface answers to common questions in seconds, instead of drawing on resources needed for more convoluted issues.\\n\\nAnswer travel policy questions\\n\\nPolicies change constantly. With conversational AI, employees can ask a chatbot and get the most up-to-date travel information instead of any older, outdated documentation.\\n\\nSend open enrollment reminders\\n\\nHelp employees make smart decisions by sending out targeted reminders to enroll in benefits programs. By sending the message via chatbot, employees can ask follow-up questions and get them answered immediately.\\n\\nAI accelerates complex HR issues\\n\\nHR issues aren’t always as simple as a question and an answer. In more complex situations, AI can play an important role: It can triage sophisticated requests. A chatbot can route issues to the right HR specialist by understanding precisely what kind of support an employee needs.\\n\\nManage payroll issues\\n\\nAddressing a payroll issue is a process that often involves many different platforms and steps, but with AI, issues can be submitted quickly and conversationally.\\n\\nHelp employees update benefits\\n\\nHR teams typically have dedicated specialists to manage benefits situations, but employees rarely know who the experts are. With a chatbot, anyone can ask for help and receive the right resources, whether they’re asking about insurance or their 401K.\\n\\nSubmit personal information change requests\\n\\nWhen someone relocates, it can take a lot of time and effort from both the employee and HR team to just update a mailing address. AI can surface a form, which can be sent directly to the team or specialist who manages relocations. No more painful phone tag.\\n\\nConduct COVID attestation follow-up\\n\\nThere are times when HR really needs to move fast. When an employee tests positive for COVID, you need to immediately get in touch with them and offer resources and assistance. A chatbot reaches out in chat, setting up a direct line of communication as soon as possible.\\n\\nVerify employment\\n\\nWhether an employee is buying a house or applying for a visa, employment verification needs to happen quickly. But — getting an employment verification letter from HR can take days. An AI-powered system cuts through red tape by helping employees find and submit the right information to the right HR specialist.\\n\\nManage training requests\\n\\nAI makes it easy for employees to request training on the fly. Instead of dealing with complicated processes on platforms they rarely visit, they can find relevant courses just by asking.\\n\\nAI connects HR systems\\n\\nModern HR teams depend on various systems to manage a half dozen different function areas. The challenge is that systems are often difficult to integrate. This puts both HR teams and employees in difficult positions. Implementing multiple standalone systems increases the risk of data inaccuracies, confuses the user experience, and creates unnecessary admin work. Here’s where AI really shines, weaving together multiple systems into a single, seamless user experience.\\n\\nManage PTO balance lookups\\n\\nHR teams are already juggling dozens of projects. Let AI help employees check their remaining PTO and request any time off in a single conversational interface.\\n\\nHandle role change requests\\n\\nAI unifies existing HR systems to provide the best up-to-date answer or action, pulling from systems like Workday. Employees don’t need to remember multiple systems, and HR teams don’t have to manually update dialog flows.\\n\\nApprove timesheets\\n\\nAI can automatically route approvals to the right hands. Managers can quickly approve a timesheet using natural language, ensuring employees get what they need ASAP.\\n\\nApprove leave requests\\n\\nThere are dozens of ways to ask about leave: My wife is pregnant; I’m interested in a sabbatical; I’m dealing with a challenging family situation. AI breaks down language to understand vague user requests and respond with relevant information and next steps.\\n\\nThe world is changing fast, and it’s up to HR teams like yours to keep your company connected. That’s why you need to find a solution that makes an immediate impact, instead of adding more to your plate.\\n\\nYou need a comprehensive solution that addresses the employee experience holistically. And when it comes to conversational AI, Moveworks is the only solution that does it all. Employees can read the latest policies, look up their PTO balance, or update their personal information in no time at all. HR teams can say goodbye to “Oh! I missed the enrollment period!” and “I need my timesheet approved now!!!” practically overnight.\\n\\nWhen it comes to HR, you can’t compromise. You need the best conversational AI.

They simply describe their requests to the Moveworks AI chatbot — in normal conversation — to get what they need right away. The second enhancement is Moveworks for Web, which provides the same conversational experience directly inside enterprise portals, including ServiceNow, SharePoint, and Epic. Combined, they deliver 24/7 help to employees in their language and channel of choice.\\n\\n\"Artificial intelligence is the only way to give immediate support to every employee — wherever they live and whatever language they speak,\" said Moveworks CEO Bhavin Shah. \"We\\'ve spent years developing the deepest understanding of what people need at work, based on hundreds of machine learning models that are trained on more than 250 million requests. Extending our technology to these new languages and platforms means our customers can empower everyone, equally, to make an impact.\"\\n\\nMoveworks is now multilingual\\n\\nMoveworks is the first solution that makes multilingual support automatic: it takes no training for employees and no scripting for support teams. Employees submit issues to Moveworks in their preferred language, just as they would to a local service desk agent, and they can even seamlessly switch to a different language on the fly. Under the hood, the platform determines the most useful solution — or combination of solutions — to each issue and responds in the appropriate language, without any human intervention.\\n\\n\"As a global company, we need to provide the same quality of support to every employee at Albemarle to empower their potential, no matter which languages they speak,\" said Patrick Thompson, CIO at Albemarle Corporation. \"Moveworks gives our people 24/7 help in their native language — just by having a natural conversation with the bot. Now, they can get support right away, without us needing localized service desks in each location.\"\\n\\nBecoming truly multilingual meant evolving the entire Moveworks Intelligence Engine,™ the array of machine learning models that power the platform. To engage with employees on their terms, Moveworks uses a probabilistic bidding system that weighs every possible response, including switching languages, rather than sticking to a script. To understand support issues in any language, the platform goes beyond translation, using bespoke NLU models trained to recognize entities, like conference room names, that shouldn\\'t be translated at all. And to resolve requests end-to-end, Moveworks employs techniques like cross-lingual information retrieval, which lets it find and rank potential answers. All of that complexity is invisible to end users, who ask for help and receive a personalized response in seconds.\\n\\nIntroducing Moveworks for Web\\n\\n\"To provide the immediate care that our patients expect, we need to support our workforce — the moment they need help,\" said Dianne Kokotoff, Executive Director of Enterprise Solutions & Automation at Wellstar Health System. \"Moveworks has made real-time support possible, meeting our team members where they work. And now with Moveworks for Web, we\\'ve brought that instant experience to ServiceNow. We\\'re looking forward to bringing the same experience to SharePoint and Epic.\"\\n\\nBy design, Moveworks intelligently \"follows\" users across channels to guarantee consistent, personalized, and secure support. An employee who engages with Moveworks via Slack to request a new laptop, for instance, is able to check the status of her request in SharePoint, without completing a separate authentication process. Both multilingual support and Moveworks for Web pave the way for more efficient and more equitable companies, where productivity doesn\\'t depend on an employee\\'s native language or unique working style.\\n\\n\"Moveworks offers the ability to go anywhere for help — email, Slack, our ServiceNow portal — and still end up in the bot\\'s hands as the first line of support,\" said Steve Januario, Vice President of Digital Employee Experience at Palo Alto Networks. \"It\\'s letting us get the fastest response, right up front.\"\\n\\nAbout Moveworks\\n\\nMoveworks is revolutionizing how companies support their employees — with the first AI platform that makes getting help at work effortless. The modern workday is full of disruptions, from IT issues to HR updates to policy changes. Moveworks understands exactly what employees need and provides the right solution in seconds, using conversational AI built for the enterprise.

This compliance validates our continued commitment to protecting your data — and affirms the security of our AI solution.\\n\\nSince we founded Moveworks, we’ve built bleeding-edge security into everything we do, from our machine learning models, to our operational practices, to our employee training. As a result, we achieved both ISO 27001 and SOC 2 Type 1 compliance in our first year out of stealth mode. SOC 2 Type 2 compliance represents the biggest milestone to date in demonstrating that, from the very beginning, we’ve prioritized security across the board.\\n\\nService Organizational Control (SOC) 2 reports ensure that compliant companies maintain confidentiality when transmitting, storing, maintaining, processing, and disposing of customer data. SOC 2 Type 1 assesses an organization’s security standards at a given moment in time, while SOC 2 Type 2 proves that the organization has maintained those standards over a sustained period. Typically, only large, mature organizations are able to achieve this level of compliance. But we've worked diligently to get ahead of the curve, understanding that we can't compromise when it comes to our customers' data.\\n\\nWhat does this mean for you?\\n\\nSimply put, it means you can trust Moveworks with your data. IT leaders place emphasis on SOC 2 Type 2 compliance because it's one of the few audits that attests to an organization's security posture over a sustained time period. Because we know that companies look to partner with vendors who not only innovate quickly, but also maintain the highest bar for security, we’ve focused on attaining compliance from the very start.\\n\\nAt a high level, our specific SOC 2 Type 2 report shows that we’ve upheld three core commitments:\\n\\n1. The Moveworks platform is secure.\\n\\nSecurity readiness policies and procedures are built into our platform. As we develop our products, we conduct frequent security code reviews and partner with third-party security experts to test for vulnerabilities.\\n\\nTo ensure that our people are as secure as our technology, we conduct in-depth security awareness training. Every employee must complete it both as part of new employee onboarding and as part of an annual education program. Additional security training is customized based on role and team to ensure that everyone is up-to-date with the latest information.\\n\\n2. Moveworks keeps your data confidential.\\n\\nWe know that data privacy is critical. That’s why all customer data in our possession is always encrypted — both in transit and at rest. For each customer, we use unique encryption keys to keep your information secure. Additionally, Moveworks employees can only access customer data on a need-to-know basis, according to strict, role-based policies and procedures.\\n\\nData confidentiality extends to how we develop our product. We use common, anonymized language to train our global machine learning models. Your private data is only used to train models specific to your organization.\\n\\n3. The Moveworks platform stays accessible.\\n\\nMoveworks is available day or night, weekdays and weekends. To maintain our 99.5% SLA availability, we rely on a leading cloud infrastructure provider to ensure all our customer data has redundant, secure backups in geographically dispersed locations.\\n\\nOur security roadmap\\n\\nSOC 2 Type 2 is a major achievement, but we work to continuously maintain and improve our core security framework over time. Our privacy and compliance roadmap includes CSA STAR, HIPAA, FedRAMP, and more. We understand that security requirements differ by industry, and we remain dedicated to meeting those requirements as Moveworks grows.\\n\\nWant to learn more?\\n\\nThe full SOC 2 Type 2 report is available upon request, in addition to more information on our architecture and security practices.

Particularly with the majority of US employees now reliant on technology to get anything done during work-from-home, solving tech issues faster has become business-critical. When an application isn’t working or you can’t log into an account, you can no longer tap the shoulder of the IT professional sitting next to you. If you’re locked out, you’re locked out.\\n\\nRegular readers of this blog know that AI can resolve many tech issues instantly, with no involvement from the help desk. About half of these issues are relatively routine — unlocking accounts, provisioning software, creating email lists — yet still take an average of three days to address using the traditional approach. Our primary focus is eliminating that delay from end to end: Employees describe their problems to our chatbot, and Moveworks solves them seconds later.\\n\\nBut what about complicated, high-touch requests, which require experts to resolve? These are the issues that often drag on for weeks, that take multiple interactions between employee and IT team, and that sometimes get lost in the shuffle for good. After analyzing millions of such complex requests, we identified three fundamental challenges:\\n\\nEvery back-and-forth between the employee and IT team adds a 1.75-day delay.\\n\\nThe standard channels for these back-and-forths — email and support portals — don’t complement employees’ regular workflows.\\n\\nThere’s simply too much information for IT teams alone to manage.\\n\\nWith the above challenges in mind, we spent the last several years engineering, testing, and implementing a single solution. The result of that effort is Moveworks Concierge: an AI system that accelerates IT issue resolution, while also providing unprecedented visibility for both employees and service desks. In this post, we’ll explain our journey from idea to impact.\\n\\nMore communication means slower resolution\\n\\nWhen tech issues take forever to fix, it’s usually because they involve lots of back-and-forth communication between IT teams and employees. At a time when other types of communication occur in seconds, exchanges with IT still span days. The primary culprit is the way IT teams engage with employees: email and siloed support portals. These channels live outside employees’ regular workflows and aren’t inherently interactive, so when high-touch issues require several conversations to complete, the whole process comes to a grinding halt:\\n\\nWhile most IT issues require less than two comments to resolve, high-touch issues that need more comments significantly increase the mean time to resolution, or MTTR.\\n\\nThe fundamental obstacle here is that IT agents need to take action every single time an issue progresses, whether the employee is asking for a status update or the IT team needs business justification. The result? Help desk agents read through thousands of ticket comments each month — an endless queue that makes communication delays inevitable.\\n\\nReducing that delay from days down to just seconds is a task tailor-made for an AI system, provided it could:\\n\\nUnderstand the language employees naturally use when talking to the IT team\\n\\nIntelligently manage thousands of IT interactions, so nothing gets lost in the shuffle\\n\\nHandle everything on the enterprise messaging tool, rather than via email or portal\\n\\nWe created Concierge to tackle these core challenges. With advanced natural language understanding (NLU), Concierge could converse directly with employees — without help desk agents needing to intervene. But in order to do so, we had to rethink such communication from the bottom up.\\n\\nThousands of IT conversations — in real time\\n\\nHow do you make communication instant and interactive? Step one is to acknowledge that email is broken, so simply moving the conversation to Slack or Microsoft Teams — where most of us now spend the workday — is a game-changer. Rapid collaboration on these messaging tools is the new normal, and we believe IT support should be no exception.\\n\\nHowever, bombarding employees with constant Slack and Teams messages is not the answer, since such an approach becomes just as cluttered as email — and just as likely to be ignored. Employees respond immediately on the messaging tool because conversations there tend to be time-sensitive and important to their job. The key for Concierge, then, would be to meet that expectation with AI — surfacing only relevant information to cut through the noise.\\n\\nIf successful, we knew Concierge would speed up tech support every step of the way. Unlike emails, which can sit unread for days or even weeks, Concierge is designed to take advantage of the nature of Slack and Teams to conduct thousands of IT conversations in real time. From allowing employees to check the status of their issues, to nudging the help desk when those issues remain unresolved, Concierge would ensure that IT help happens as quickly as other enterprise workflows.\\n\\nConcierge comprises numerous capabilities — three of which are especially responsible for accelerating resolution:\\n\\nConcierge saves time and money for IT teams\\n\\nNeedless to say, what matters isn’t just good ideas but actual results.\\n\\nConcierge cut the average resolution time for high-touch IT issues in half.\\n\\nFaster resolution time for the average IT issue, by individual Moveworks Concierge capability.\\n\\nCrucially, this acceleration does not disrupt backend workflows or force IT teams to adjust to a new process. Instead, Concierge handles employee-facing communication and uses AI to drive faster engagement, enabling those teams to concentrate on resolving issues. We built Concierge to do what AI does best — manage a mind-numbing amount of information — to complement the areas where IT specialists excel.\\n\\nFor the large enterprises that have already implemented Concierge — Equinix, Autodesk, Broadcom, Nutanix, and Medallia, to name a few — such time savings translate directly to profits. With multimillion-dollar IT budgets to maximize, better efficiency means not only fewer delays for employees but also more resources to allocate on other projects.\\n\\nIn the era of remote work, productive employees are those who collaborate on tools like Slack and Microsoft Teams, in real time, wherever they’re located. Concierge brings this new normal to IT communications, allowing employees to add comments, receive updates, and request action on tech issues on the messaging tool. From a financial perspective, of course, IT organizations that don’t eliminate friction with AI are leaving money on the table. But beyond the bottom line, Concierge empowers IT teams to support employees at the speed of modern business.\\n\\nContact  Moveworks to learn how AI can speed up your IT support.\\n\\nproduct features\\n\\nMore blog posts\\n\\nHow to unlock continual service improvement with AIOps\\n      \\n        \\n          Discover how AIOps transforms IT operations from reactive to proactive.

Open and extensible, it supports both public and private AI models so that Salesforce customers can elevate CRM efficiency with out-of-the-box generative AI.\\n\\nGithub’s Copilot: An AI-driven code completion copilot which helps developers write code more efficiently by suggesting entire lines or blocks of code. By learning from the context and past code in a repository, Github Copilot offers tailored recommendations, reducing development time and making the coding process more intuitive.\\n\\nMoveworks’ Enterprise Copilot: An AI copilot that helps employees automate tasks and access information across all enterprise applications using a single natural language interface. It supports a multitude of functions, such as password resets, PTO requests, or expense submissions, and ensures seamless support for all employees, regardless of their language or preferred communication channel.\\n\\nAs AI continues to develop rapidly, copilots will play an increasingly vital role in helping users streamline their tasks and better use their digital resources. In light of this, defining a well-structured copilot strategy becomes essential for businesses aiming to harness the full potential of AI technology.\\n\\nWhat does it take to build a copilot-like experience into your enterprise?\\n\\nBefore developing an AI copilot strategy, you need to understand what it takes to build a copilot-like experience into your enterprise. There is a vast difference between ChatGPT and an enterprise copilot platform that is fully integrated within an organization. This is not to say that ChatGPT isn’t helpful. It is incredibly helpful for certain use cases. But it’s limited in its ability.\\n\\nFor a copilot to own more enterprise-focused tasks, you need a less general, more tailored approach that can manage:\\n\\nDomain-specific requirements: Understanding the unique needs, challenges, and objectives of each department involved in the copilot is crucial. That includes a wide range of enterprise service needs — identity, permissions, security, compliance, and more.\\n\\nRelevant data inputs: The key to building a copilot is to gather and process relevant data specific to each domain. This requires a team of annotators to provide tags, descriptions, ratings, translations, and well-researched examples so the copilot can provide the best possible support.\\n\\nSystem integrations: Connect the copilot to the right tools, technologies, and systems for each department, ensuring seamless collaboration across domain-specific applications.\\n\\nCustom AI models: Fine-tune the LLMs according to domain-specific data sources, desired outcomes, and unique challenges specific to each domain for more accurate decision-making.\\n\\nStrong analytics and data science team: Staff with expertise in data analysis and machine learning development are required to support the copilot\\'s learning and optimization and ensure that the experience improves over time instead of degrading.\\n\\nConsistent, intuitive user experience: To maintain a straightforward and seamless interaction with the copilot, you need a conversational AI system that lets users easily take full advantage of its capabilities.\\n\\nRobust security infrastructure: Especially for an enterprise copilot, engaging with security experts to safeguard sensitive enterprise data, protect user privacy, and adhere to necessary compliance measures is mandatory.\\n\\nGiven the above, it should be clear that incorporating a copilot experience into your organization takes considerable effort. While some use cases might be lighter lifts, others will require heavy, long-term maintenance. The scope of the problem you’re trying to solve will require varying degrees of investment. For example, using AI to provide enterprise-wide support will, by definition, need a much better understanding of and investment in the bullets above than using AI to write web copy.\\n\\nFigure 1: When looking at AI copilot use cases, we start to see the relationship between the scope of the problem and the investment required to solve it, enabling decision-makers to make informed choices when embracing LLMs for their organizations.\\n\\nThis is to say that an AI copilot is not something you can build and maintain on your own, particularly if you want to expand its functionality across the enterprise. Investing in the right partner with the right resources is the key to successfully implementing a helpful and efficient AI copilot.\\n\\nThe four-tiered AI copilot strategy framework\\n\\nWe created a four-tiered framework to help leaders better understand the technology and investments necessary to integrate LLMs into production environments.\\n\\nBy grasping the nuances between various AI copilots and their unique capabilities and limitations, you will be better equipped to create a compelling and tailored strategy for your organization.\\n\\nTier-one copilot: Basic LLM integration\\n\\nA tier-one copilot involves a basic API call of a large language model (LLM). In this approach, prompt engineering is used to help a user access general information, and the copilot is primarily aimed at improving efficiency across high-level use cases.\\n\\nTier-one copilot use case examples\\n\\nA tier-one copilot simplifies various everyday tasks by leveraging AI-powered assistance. Some common use cases include:\\n\\nGenerating content suggestions for social media posts\\n\\nAuto-completing email drafts or responses\\n\\nProviding answers to frequently asked questions\\n\\nSummarizing general content\\n\\nIdentifying and fixing grammar and style errors\\n\\nPerforming sentiment analysis on sales call transcripts\\n\\nFigure 2:\\xa0Tier-one copilots rely on basic LLM integrations to solve small-scale enterprise challenges.\\n\\nWhat you need to get started with a tier-one copilot\\n\\nTier-one copilots are relatively easy to kick off, requiring minimal resources and offering a low barrier to entry, making them an attractive starting point for organizations exploring AI tools.\\n\\nLaunching the copilot boils down to accessing an LLM, such as GPT-4. LLM-as-a-service providers, like Hugging Face and OpenAI, make this process even more accessible. You simply subscribe to a reliable API provider for your chosen LLM and integrate their API into your software or platform. This streamlined approach needs little beyond developer resources dedicated to implementing the API integration, ensuring a smooth and cost-effective way to introduce AI-driven assistance into your organization.\\n\\nKey machine learning technique: Prompt engineering\\n\\nPrompt engineering is a crucial machine learning technique that bolsters the effectiveness of tier-one copilots.\\n\\nBy thoughtfully crafting and refining user prompts based on previous interactions, you can elicit more accurate model responses that better align with users\\' needs. While prompt engineering is more art than science, advanced tactics such as auto-prompting and prompt tuning can significantly enhance your tier-one copilot\\'s performance, taking it one step closer to the desired outcome.\\n\\nStrengths of the tier-one copilot\\n\\nRapid deployment with a low upfront cost: With quick implementations that involve minimal developer resources and low entry barriers, tier-one copilots are an ideal starting point for organizations venturing into AI-driven assistance.\\n\\nAccess to general AI capabilities: Generating content via a conversational interface streamlines and enhances user interactions across common use cases.\\n\\nBasic customization: Slight adjustments can be made to the copilot\\'s behavior to suit the specific needs of a business while still maintaining its general functionality and versatility.\\n\\nLimitations of the tier-one copilot\\n\\nLimited domain and organizational specificity: Their effectiveness is primarily confined to the given use cases, with limited scope for more complex or specialized tasks.\\n\\nPotential for hallucinations: Tier-one copilots may exhibit lower accuracy in domain-specific tasks, as they are not customized for each unique industry or field.\\n\\nAPI costs can become expensive based on usage: The success of a tier-one copilot relies on third-party API providers for LLM access and support, which could result in increased operational expenses as usage scales.\\n\\nSecurity and privacy worries: Entrusting sensitive information to a third-party service can raise concerns regarding data confidentiality and compliance with industry-specific regulations.\\n\\nTier-two copilot: Customized LLM implementation\\n\\nA tier-two copilot is a customized implementation of an LLM fine-tuned and grounded with an organization\\'s domain-specific data. Unlike off-the-shelf models trained on general internet data, tier-two copilots are designed to perform tasks and generate answers that cater to specialized areas.\\n\\nTier-two copilot use case examples\\n\\nA tier-two copilot is better prepared to manage some domain-specific tasks. Some common use cases include:\\n\\nTranslating IT support tickets\\n\\nDrafting an FAQ for the Finance department\\n\\nSummarizing legal documents\\n\\nGenerating industry-specific content for marketing materials\\n\\nAssisting with medical diagnosis based on patient symptoms and medical history\\n\\nIdentifying trends in customer feedback data and providing actionable insights\\n\\nFigure 3: Tier-two copilots offer more customized LLM implementations.\\n\\nWhat you need to get started with a tier-two copilot\\n\\nDeveloping a tier-two copilot involves a substantial upfront investment in resources and expertise. Key elements include pre-trained models, supporting infrastructure such as GPUs, and a skilled team of developers and machine learning engineers capable of selecting a suitable pre-trained model, like LLaMA, RoBERTa, MPNet, or Flan-T5, and fine-tuning it with the organization\\'s domain data for a more customized LLM implementation.\\n\\nAnnotation is also critical for this more focused approach. And while the annotation process can commence with external service providers like Scale.ai, it’s essential to transition in-house as you advance to higher tiers with increased domain specificity and scrutiny.\\n\\nAlthough tier-two copilots demand more resources and investment than their tier-one counterparts, the payoff is a high-performance, domain-specific AI solution that tackles your organization\\'s unique challenges.\\n\\nKey machine learning techniques: Fine-tuning, grounding, retrieval augmentation\\n\\nOptimizing the performance of an AI-driven copilot necessitates leveraging key machine learning techniques such as fine-tuning, grounding, and retrieval augmentation.\\n\\nFine-tuning involves adapting the chosen base model to a specific task using labeled, domain-specific data. Then, both grounding and retrieval augmentation can enhance the copilot\\'s factuality and accuracy by utilizing contextual information from user data, unique entities, query patterns, and curated documents.\\n\\nThese techniques work in harmony to deliver tailored AI-driven assistance that caters to an organization\\'s unique needs and challenges, providing highly relevant, meaningful, and contextually accurate results.\\n\\nStrengths of the tier-two copilot\\n\\nEnhanced domain-specific performance: The tier-two copilot\\'s customization, fine-tuning, and domain-specific learning improve accuracy and effectiveness within a specific industry or field.\\n\\nReduced security and privacy risks: Transitioning from third-party APIs to an in-house solution lead to better control of sensitive data, addressing safety concerns and compliance with industry-specific regulations.\\n\\nPotential cost savings over API usage: Although the initial investment may be higher, developing a tier-two copilot can lead to long-term savings by eliminating dependency on third-party API providers and minimizing usage costs.\\n\\nLowered risk of hallucination: Specialized training, grounding, and retrieval augmentation techniques can reduce the chance of inaccurate responses or hallucinations, ensuring more reliable AI assistance.\\n\\nLimitations of the tier-two copilot\\n\\nLimited to single-step use cases: Tier-two copilots are primarily designed to handle tasks that involve singular, discrete actions. As such, they may not be suitable for managing complex, multi-step processes or facilitating comprehensive workflow solutions.\\n\\nLimited actionability for each use case: As tier-two copilots only offer basic support for individual use cases, their ability to deliver actionable insights or automate next steps is limited.\\n\\nLimited performance and control with a single LLM: With a tier-two copilot, organizations only have access to one language model, which may result in poor performance for certain tasks that require more advanced reasoning, contextual understanding, or domain-specific expertise.\\n\\nRisk of missing or stale data: Tier-two copilots may face challenges in staying up-to-date with the latest information and trends, potentially leading to decision-making based on stale or incomplete data. This limitation further underscores the need for ongoing monitoring and maintenance to ensure the efficacy of the copilot.\\n\\nTier-three copilot: Advanced LLM pipelines\\n\\nA tier-three copilot involves chaining multiple LLMs together, creating sophisticated pipelines optimized for multi-step use cases that leverage the strengths and capabilities of each LLM involved. As a result, the tier-three copilot can provide tailored assistance and solutions for intricate domain-specific challenges.\\n\\nTier-three copilot use case examples\\n\\nBy incorporating multiple LLMs and advanced techniques, tier-three copilots can tackle a broader range of use cases, enhance productivity and efficiency, and address challenges in more sophisticated domains. Some common use cases include:\\n\\nAnalyzing medical literature\\n\\nAutomating account team follow-up\\n\\nProviding multilingual IT and HR support\\n\\nModerating content\\n\\nAssisting in the creation and evaluation of financial models and projections\\n\\nAnalyzing and optimizing supply chain operations for businesses\\n\\nFigure 4: Tier-three copilots bring together multiple LLMs to manage complex use cases.\\n\\nWhat you need to get started with a tier-three copilot\\n\\nTo get started with a tier-three copilot, there are several key elements and investments you need to consider. First, you must create a multi-LLM stack consisting of various pre-trained models designed to work together for more complex tasks. It is essential to have connectors in place to enable seamless system integrations and facilitate the interactions between different LLMs.\\n\\nAs is also the case with tier-two copilots, investing in fine-tuning is crucial for optimizing the models in the multi-LLM stack. Along with this, system integrations help the copilot assimilate into your organization\\'s existing workflows and automation.\\n\\nAllocating resources for annotators to generate high-quality domain-specific data will ensure improved performance for your copilot. Likewise, assembling dedicated AI and machine learning teams is vital for developing, implementing, and optimizing the tier-three copilot.\\n\\nKey machine learning techniques: Chaining, entity extraction and linking, connectors\\n\\nDeveloping a robust tier-three copilot capable of tackling complex, multi-step tasks involves several advanced machine learning techniques.\\n\\nFirst, chaining allows for the seamless integration of multiple LLMs in a pipeline, tapping into the combined strengths of each model for superior performance. This is further complemented by entity extraction and linking, which enable the identification and correlation of crucial data points within the input context, providing richer layers of information for the copilot.\\n\\nConnectors also play a vital role as intermediaries between the LLM stack and existing systems, facilitating efficient communication and enhancing the overall coherence of the AI-driven solution. By incorporating these sophisticated techniques, tier-three copilots can effectively address intricate use cases, driving productivity and efficiency within an organization.\\n\\nStrengths of the tier-three copilot\\n\\nHigh control and performance: By tapping into the unique strengths of each LLM, tier-three copilots can generate more accurate, contextually aware, and actionable insights across diverse scenarios, meeting the demands of complex problem-solving within organizations.\\n\\nMore actions involving existing systems: These copilots can be effectively integrated with current systems in the organization, allowing for seamless execution of additional actions and support within the established infrastructure.\\n\\nLimitations of the tier-three copilot\\n\\nChallenging to scale for enterprise-wide business problems: Tier-three copilots, while excelling in complex tasks, may encounter difficulties when attempting to scale for larger, enterprise-wide issues that require a more comprehensive approach and broader LLM coverage.\\n\\nRisk of cognitive overload for users: As tier-three copilots employ advanced techniques and multi-step actions, users may be overwhelmed by the increased complexity and multitude of interactions within the AI-driven solution.\\n\\nTier-four copilot: Enterprise-wide LLM adoption\\n\\nTier-four copilots work to address the challenges inherent in providing extensible employee support and facilitating autonomous decision-making.\\n\\nAs a sophisticated LLM system specifically designed for enterprise-wide deployment, these tier-four copilots encompass advanced features like a reasoning engine, analytics, security, and privacy, as well as out-of-the-box connectors catering to the demanding requirements of large organizations.\\n\\nTier-four copilot use case examples\\n\\nA tier-four copilot can handle issues across multiple functions, channels, languages, and departments. Here are just a handful of examples:\\n\\nProviding enterprise-wide support\\n\\nAssisting with decision-making by providing insights, predictions, and recommendations\\n\\nMonitoring compliance and security\\n\\nManaging intellectual property\\n\\nUplevelling customer service and engagement\\n\\nCurating and generating content across an organization\\n\\nFigure 5: Tier-four copilots are specifically designed for enterprise-wide deployment.\\n\\nWhat you need to get started with a tier-four copilot\\n\\nAccuracy and factuality are of paramount importance when incorporating a tier-four copilot in enterprise settings such as legal, corporate development, or finance departments.

And because no two issues have exactly the same wording, service desks must manually resolve each one — from resetting passwords to provisioning software to answering questions about policy.\\n\\nNew employees, for instance, inevitably encounter a number of IT issues during onboarding, such as: “Hi! I joined the marketing team two days ago and I just realized I don’t have a Zoom Pro license. I’m sure you get a ton of these requests, but I’d really appreciate help as soon as possible. Thanks!” At most companies, this kind of issue requires the attention of service desk agents, who read through a long and complex description to find what is often a simple fix.\\n\\nIn fact, under the surface, one-of-a-kind support requests describe surprisingly similar problems. The rise of SaaS applications in particular — Zoom, Salesforce, Office 365 — is driving homogeneity across companies and industries, which means that just a handful of automated workflows can resolve thousands of issues on the back end. Ultimately, the challenge for us at Moveworks is to understand the unique ways that employees talk about these same issues.\\n\\nFigure 1: While every company is unquestionably unique, many use the same IT to conduct business.\\n\\nOne of the critical techniques we use to understand these support tickets is Collective Learning. At Moveworks, we benefit from analyzing over 75 million IT issues, and by analyzing what they have in common, our machine learning models can understand the language employees use to explain their IT problems. In this blog, we'll cover:\\n\\nThe techniques behind Collective Learning\\n\\nHow Collective Learning breaks down complex IT issues\\n\\nThe impact of Collective Learning for both service desks and employees\\n\\nUncovering the structure of IT issues\\n\\nThe idea behind Collective Learning is simple: strength in numbers. What we realized was that — as a third party — Moveworks could aggregate data from dozens of different companies to gain universal insights about seemingly unique IT issues.\\n\\nBehind the scenes, Collective Learning requires pooling anonymized data from as many sources as possible. Anonymization has two major benefits: first, protecting internal data; and second, allowing our models to identify linguistic patterns under the surface.\\n\\nAfter we anonymize data, the next step is normalization, which throws these patterns into sharp relief. Simply put, normalization means transforming language into a generic form in order to highlight common characteristics. Consider Figure 2. “Mark” and “sales email list” are specific nouns, but, these entities can be considered in broader, more universal categories, like $PERSON or $GROUP. By generalizing these entities, a model receives a large input of training data relevant to the IT world and applicable across many companies and industries.\\n\\nFigure 2: By normalizing data, specific entities become generic entities,\\n\\nwhich can be used to train machine learning systems.\\n\\nCollective Learning in action\\n\\nSo what does Collective Learning look like in a live environment?\\n\\nLet’s explore Figure 3: three different questions from three different organizations in three different industries. Attempting to train a machine learning system on these specific issues at each company will result in poor performance because there are simply not enough examples.\\n\\nFigure 3:\\n\\nCollective Learning takes advantage of common IT entities,\\n\\nlike video conferencing application, to automatically resolve issues.\\n\\nFigure 4:\\n\\nCollective Learning applies this logic of normalizing entities to entire sentences,\\n\\nilluminating patterns across companies and industries.\\n\\nDespite starting with only a couple of examples, generalizing language patterns allows us to generate many alternate combinations. That way, our machine learning models already recognize the structure of future issues — even if they look different from the original examples.\\n\\nFigure 5: Learning language patterns lets us generate similar utterances from a few examples.\\n\\nThe power of the collective\\n\\nIn the past, machine learning has been the exclusive domain of large enterprises, which have access to larger data sets. The power of Collective Learning lies in allowing smaller companies to reap the benefits of machine learning — by transforming a couple of examples into millions of data points.\\n\\n99.9% of IT entities, without additional training.\\n\\nFigure 6:\\n\\nAs our customer base grows and we continue to collect IT ticket data,\\n\\nMoveworks’ ability to recognize entities increases exponentially.\\n\\nThanks to Collective Learning, Moveworks immediately understands our customers’ IT environments, regardless of their size or industry. Every company has its own support challenges, of course, but understanding the language of IT issues shouldn’t be one of them. The trick is capturing the right information, giving machine learning models the data needed to make accurate predictions about what employees need. For Moveworks, that trick is Collective Learning.\\n\\nContact  Moveworks to learn how AI can supercharge your workforce productivity.\\n\\ntechnology\\n\\nMore blog posts\\n\\nHow to unlock continual service improvement with AIOps\\n      \\n        \\n          Discover how AIOps transforms IT operations from reactive to proactive.

Fortunately, for many common issues, the IT team can all but eliminate that delay by providing automatic resolution, powered by artificial intelligence. We’ve already seen on this blog how AI tackles tickets that once took three days to remediate and handles them from start to finish in under a minute.\\n\\nOf course, there will always be some issues that require human intervention — AI software can’t replace the toner in your printer, for instance. In these cases, it’s critical to get the right subject matter experts involved as quickly as possible. The trouble is, for most service desk teams, assigning tickets to the correct resolver group is complex, slow, and prone to human error.\\n\\nIt takes an average of five hours, in fact, before an IT service desk agent first looks at an employee-submitted IT ticket, based on Moveworks’ analysis of millions of such tickets across dozens of organizations. For most of that time, the ticket is simply sitting in a queue in an IT service desk system, waiting for someone to review it and then either act on it or route it to a different team. In an era when business travel, conference rooms, and even catered lunches can be reserved in a matter of moments, urgent IT issues still spend hours or days before the remediation process even begins.\\n\\nFigure 1: IT tickets can take days to reach the right hands with the proper context — all before resolution gets underway.\\n\\nIn Part 1 of this two-part series, I’ll explore the many obstacles that have hindered efficient ticket routing in the past, from insufficient contextual knowledge to the challenge of small datasets. Next week in Part 2, I’ll then explain how Moveworks uses machine learning (ML) to overcome these obstacles and route tickets to the best “assignment group” in seconds, including in organizations with hundreds of assignment groups that are each responsible for a specific type of issue. But first, we need to understand the problem:\\n\\nHow service desk teams manually resolve IT tickets\\n\\nIT support organizations typically organize themselves into a three-tiered support model:\\n\\nLevel-1 (L1): Personnel who possess broad — but not deep — technical knowledge. They solve common support issues for which there are known solutions or workarounds.\\n\\nLevel-2 (L2): Technical support specialists who are experts in specific products or services. They have deep knowledge within their discrete area of expertise.\\n\\nLevel-3 (L3): Engineers, architects, or product experts, called in to resolve issues only in exceptional circumstances when all other options have been exhausted.\\n\\nFigure 2: Common IT tickets like this one are easy to fix — but still can spend hours in the queue.\\n\\nMore complex issues to troubleshoot, like “I lost access to a database on an internal server,” cannot be resolved by the L1 team — they require a technical support specialist. So when this variety of ticket appears in their queue, L1 agents read the ticket content and must then assign it to an L2 support team. But with dozens or even hundreds of available support groups to choose from, it isn’t hard to see why L1 agents frequently assign the ticket to the wrong L2 team.\\n\\nAt this point, tickets can fall victim to what’s known as the “ping-pong effect” — getting assigned back and forth between the L1 service desk and different support teams until finally reaching the right one. Each ticket reassignment can add hours to the life of a ticket. And needless to say, this effect is a headache for everyone involved: employees wait in the dark for their ticket to be assigned, support teams deflect away misrouted tickets, and IT leadership fields complaints from both groups.\\n\\nDifferent organizations face different challenges\\n\\nUsing this conventional system, organizations have to strike a difficult balance. On one hand, it’s useful to have lots of very precise assignment groups so that tickets get to the subject matter expert faster. On the other hand, with too many assignment groups, service desk agents struggle to identify the right group — usually from a picklist in the service desk software — for a given ticket. Faced with this long list, agents tend to use the few assignment groups they’re most familiar with, which, in turn, forces a second agent to do another round of triage to remedy the error.\\n\\nIn an attempt to avoid these complications, some companies have outsourced their L1 and L2 service desks to a managed service provider (MSP). According to a 2017 survey by Harvey Nash and KPMG, 32% of companies now use an MSP for their service desks, enabling them, at least in theory, to focus their efforts on core business initiatives rather than on IT issues. But while MSPs offer an alternative business and organizational model for IT support, they don’t address the functional difficulties of ticket routing. The core predicament still exists: no human can accurately remember the responsibilities of each assignment group when there are 50 or more to choose from — even within specialized IT support companies like MSPs.\\n\\nFigure 3: Routing a ticket to one of 50 or more assignment groups is a challenge for human agents.\\n\\nThis type of problem — one involving hard-to-remember values, large volumes of relatively similar inputs, and often significant time pressure — is tailor-made for machine learning. As we’ll see in the following sections, however, applying ML to an individual organization’s IT support infrastructure is a daunting task.\\n\\nThe pitfalls of classical machine learning models\\n\\nThe job of a machine learning system is to learn from past data to generate predictive models, also known as ML models, that will inform the system’s decisions. In the case of IT ticket triage, the predictive model reads various fields of a ticket to predict what the assignment group value (and other ticket fields, if desired) should be.\\n\\nClassical machine learning models that tried to predict these values learned only from the short description — essentially the subject line of the ticket — and one or two other, hand-picked fields. By consuming just a few input values, which are called “features” in the ML community, learning algorithms missed out on a mountain of useful data. And because classical learning required the IT team to choose those few features in advance, it forced them to ignore fields that could have ultimately provided the best basis for making triage predictions. By contrast, the latest approaches to machine learning can consider all fields of a ticket and mathematically determine which are most predictive — but we’ll save that discussion for Part 2.\\n\\nFigure 4: Making sense of data entails training ML models on certain features, but deciding which features are predictive requires sophisticated, modern techniques like BERT.\\n\\nBeyond the feature selection challenge, perhaps the biggest barrier standing in the way of automated ticket triaging is the small data problem. Historically speaking, machine learning has relied on “big data”: datasets that are sizable enough to reveal patterns and generate insights. But the ticket history of a single organization is usually too small to power deep learning on its own; in fact, even large organizations with tens of thousands of IT tickets may not have enough data to get good results from deep learning, which in general requires a million-plus data points. And as we show in the illustration below, the actual number of tickets to learn from is far smaller than expected, since each round of filtering the tickets reduces the number exponentially.\\n\\nFigure 5: Even in a company with 2,000 employees like the one above, ticket triaging models must be able to cope with small amounts of data, since each assignment group only deals with a handful of tickets regarding a particular IT issue.\\n\\nFor ML models that learn from just one organization, the small data conundrum marks the end of the road, since each new ticket might be entirely unfamiliar to the model. It’s the equivalent of googling the word “platypus” and having the search results predicated on just your own previous search history about platypuses — which is likely nonexistent — as opposed to the billions upon billions of related searches that actually inform Google’s algorithms. Of course, as we learned, different organizations face different challenges in the IT domain, so generalizing between them isn’t easy. But insights about the similarity of words, as well as the role they play in determining a sentence’s overall meaning, are more universal. Again, that’s Part 2.\\n\\nAchieving instant ticket triage with deep learning\\n\\nThe long delay that comes after submitting an IT ticket seems to be an unfortunate fact of life. Service desk agents are always busy, and as human beings, they’re inevitably susceptible to human error. Consistently assigning IT tickets to precisely the right resolver group, with all of the right information, in under a minute is simply not a realistic goal given the myriad assignment groups in most organizations. And while classical machine learning models attempt to address this problem by making automated routing decisions, they suffer from major shortcomings:\\n\\nLack of context: Early ML models for automatic ticket triage tended to learn only from tickets’ short description and one or two other fields, ignoring a mountain of useful data.\\n\\nReliance on guesswork: Absent the ability to analyze every field in a ticket, these early models forced the service desk team to guess ahead of time — and without sufficient knowledge — which fields would be the most predictive.\\n\\nSmall data conundrum: By only ingesting tickets from a single IT service desk, these models failed to capture enough information to make effective routing decisions.\\n\\nNot grouping words by meaning: Without grouping each word by its broader category or attempting to understand its meaning in context, classical ML models couldn’t capitalize on the predictive power of employees’ descriptions.\\n\\nBut that, thankfully, is not the end of the story. A seemingly uncrackable code just a few years ago, the problem of automated ticket triage has today been overcome with deep learning and supporting techniques.

Within just one month of deployment, Starburst saw an average of 50% autonomous IT and HR issue resolution through the Moveworks bot, with 62% of employees using the bot as their first line of defense for all support issues.\\n\\nStarburst is a hyper-growth company with a staggering\\xa0valuation of $3.3B.\\xa0The company saw 122% YoY customer growth and 61% YoY employee growth in Q2 of this year alone. With each new employee added, Starburst has several key considerations top of mind — like ensuring a smooth onboarding process, providing support for any questions in a timely manner, and making sure employees have the hardware and software they need to be successful. Starburst wanted the ability to deliver this experience at scale without having to place the heavy manual burden on its existing IT and HR teams.\\n\\nThat’s why Starburst chose Moveworks: to scale employee support with AI so IT and HR teams can increase efficiency and focus on more complex problems that drive the business forward.\\n\\n“Getting new employees quickly ramped is critical to maintain our momentum,” said Kevin Smith, Director of Information Technology at Starburst. “But successful onboarding isn’t as simple as getting someone up and running on week one. It’s getting them answers to their most critical questions throughout their entire onboarding experience — which can take up to a year. At the rate we’re growing, it’s just not possible to provide that same quality support experience without the help of a sophisticated AI platform like Moveworks.”\\n\\nStarting from their first day on the job, Moveworks will provide Starburst employees with one place to go for all of their support needs — all in their preferred language. When they experience an IT issue or have an HR-related question, they’ll simply message the Moveworks bot within Slack and the issue will either be automatically resolved within seconds. And, if the bot isn’t able to resolve the issue autonomously, it’ll be routed to the appropriate contact for accelerated support. Moveworks will also streamline internal processes with automated workflows. It will automatically reset passwords, provision software, pass along policy updates, update permissions, request or troubleshoot hardware, and look up people or places — all within Slack so employees don’t need to leave their preferred communication platform.\\n\\n“Effective onboarding increases productivity, accelerates employees’ time to value, and increases operational efficiency in the long run,” said Bhavin Shah, CEO of Moveworks. “When it comes to hyper-growth companies, like Starburst, these are all critical factors in maintaining and increasing momentum. Conversational AI is truly the only way to deliver an onboarding experience that enables these results in a way that’s scalable, cost-effective, and highly efficient.”\\n\\nTo schedule a demo of Moveworks, visit:\\xa0https://www.moveworks.com/request-demo\\n\\nMedia Contact\\n\\nSophia Xepoleas, Sr PR Manager\\n\\nEmail:\\n\\npr@moveworks.ai\\n\\nWeb:\\n\\nMoveworks.com/contact\\n\\nSolutions\\n\\nCustomers\\n\\nResources\\n\\nBlog\\n\\nSitemap\\n\\nPlatform\\n\\nPlatform overview\\n\\nMoveworks API\\n\\nSystem status\\n\\nCompany\\n\\nAbout us\\n\\nNewsroom\\n\\nContact us\\n\\nCareers\\n\\n©2023 Moveworks, Inc.\\n\\nPrivacy policies', metadata={'source': 'https://www.moveworks.com/press-releases/2023/01/moveworks-ai-enables-starburst-to-streamline-employee-onboarding-amid-rapid-growth'}),\n",

The joint solutions enabled by the partnership allow customers to transform their IT departments from cost centers to strategic assets. These joint solutions provide a scalable, cost-effective IT solution that improves both operational efficiency and employee satisfaction.\\n\\nEmployees submit, on average, 1.1 IT tickets per month, with a typical wait time of 3 days before they’re resolved. For large enterprises, this has a serious impact on employee productivity and the overall bottom line. As it turns out, 60% of these tickets are extremely routine for service desk agents — like resetting passwords, providing access to software, following up with employees, and more. The Moveworks and Wipro partnership aims to eliminate this problem altogether with the help of AI.\\n\\n“While employee experience is at the forefront of digital workplace transformation in the hybrid model of work, driving digital imperatives for enterprises with a focus on personalization and human-digital augmentation is key,” said Jo Debecker, Senior Vice President & Global Head, Cloud and Infrastructure Services, Wipro Limited. “This requires empowering employees with AI-powered contextualized, omni-channel support that is effective at point of need and promotes automation at scale. With our strategic partnership with Moveworks, we bring in advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms, collective intelligence, dynamic language core, deep semantic match engine and a probabilistic approach to decision-making. So, employees can focus on the bigger projects that drive the business forward.”\\n\\nEmployees simply chat with the Moveworks bot within their existing messaging tool — like Microsoft Teams or Slack. The Moveworks bot then uses hundreds of machine learning and natural language understanding models to resolve issues instantly. And, if the bot can’t resolve it autonomously, Moveworks routes the request to the appropriate service desk agent for accelerated support. Wipro's deep industry knowledge and domain expertise in the digital workplace complements these deep AI and machine learning capabilities.\\n\\nWipro offers businesses the scalable service desk experience required for businesses to keep up with growing IT demand. Together, the partnership offers employees a simple, streamlined IT experience. And, it saves businesses a significant amount of time, money, and resources that were previously dedicated to keeping up with increasing demand.\\n\\n“Businesses are stuck between a rock and a hard place,” said Bhavin Shah, CEO of Moveworks. “A positive employee experience remains critical for running a successful business, but the looming recession means there is more pressure than ever to improve operational efficiency. Our partnership with Wipro gives businesses the best of both worlds. Not only do customers get best-in-class support for their employees, they’ll also increase productivity and have access to the insights they need to improve operational efficiency as a result.”\\n\\nClients of Moveworks and Wipro have already greatly reduced their service desk costs, as well as their mean time to resolution (MTTR) for employee issues — including some of the top manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies, and technology vendors from around the world. And, because Moveworks’ machine learning models continuously learn over time, these numbers will only continue to improve.\\n\\nTo schedule a demo of Moveworks, visit: https://www.moveworks.com/request-demo\\n\\nMedia Contact\\n\\nSophia Xepoleas, Sr PR Manager\\n\\nEmail:\\n\\npr@moveworks.ai\\n\\nWeb:\\n\\nMoveworks.com/contact\\n\\nSolutions\\n\\nCustomers\\n\\nResources\\n\\nBlog\\n\\nSitemap\\n\\nPlatform\\n\\nPlatform overview\\n\\nMoveworks API\\n\\nSystem status\\n\\nCompany\\n\\nAbout us\\n\\nNewsroom\\n\\nContact us\\n\\nCareers\\n\\n©2023 Moveworks, Inc.\\n\\nPrivacy policies\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.moveworks.com/press-releases/2022/11/moveworks-and-wipro-partner-to-deliver-scalable-best-in-class-it-support-with-ai'}),\n",

From IBM Watson’s victory over human Jeopardy champions in 2011, to DeepMind's defeat of the world’s best Go players in 2016, to Libratus’s win against millionaire poker pros in 2017,\\xa0ML is redrawing the boundaries of the possible in math, logic, and strategy.\\n\\nYet one of the last frontiers left for machines to demystify — the nuances of language — has long remained an uncrackable code.\\n\\nThe result? While ML automates routine tasks across nearly every industry, those that require language comprehension still tend to be performed by human professionals, creating busy work for them as well as frustrating delays for all involved. The complex way that we communicate with one another simply cannot be reduced to fixed rules, decision trees, and other hard-coded strategies that previous language understanding models have employed.\\n\\nFigure 1: Unlike math problems that computers can approach as a series of discrete operations, the meaning of a sentence can’t be gleaned from its individual words without context.\\n\\nA notable example here is the challenge of routing IT support tickets to the right subject matter experts. As I discussed in Part 1 of this series, the average IT ticket sits in a queue for five hours before a help desk agent first looks at it, at which point the agent must decide which among hundreds of specialized “assignment groups” is the correct one. This anachronistically slow and error-prone process is an obvious candidate for a machine learning solution, yet past ML-powered attempts at automated triaging were unsuccessful for the reasons listed in Part 1:\\n\\nLack of context: Early ML models for automatic ticket triage tended to learn only from tickets’ short descriptions and one or two other inputs, ignoring a mountain of useful data.\\n\\nReliance on guesswork: Absent the ability to analyze all the information in a ticket, these early models forced the service desk team to guess ahead of time — and without sufficient knowledge — which fields would be the most predictive.\\n\\nSmall data conundrum: By only ingesting tickets from a single IT service desk, these models failed to capture enough information to make effective routing decisions.\\n\\nNot grouping words by meaning: Without grouping each word by its broader category or attempting to understand its meaning in context, classical ML models couldn’t capitalize on the predictive power of employees’ descriptions.\\n\\nIn the sections below, I’ll explore how we overcame each of those sizable obstacles by synthesizing a number of new approaches to ML, including bleeding-edge techniques like BERT. Ultimately, after years in the making, ML can now triage IT support tickets with better than human-level accuracy — and at machine speed.\\n\\nLearning from your tickets\\n\\nAt a high level, automated ticket triage entails correlating an IT ticket’s various fields with the assignment group that can best resolve the issue — exactly what help desks are trained to do. Enter deep learning: a family of ML based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) that emulate the variable connections our brains form over time between related concepts, albeit in a more formalized fashion. To train neural networks, Moveworks uses supervised learning, which includes the following operations:\\n\\nAnalyze labeled historical data, known as training data. Labeled data means that the correct output values — in this case, the right assignment group for a given ticket — are known in advance.\\n\\nIdentify which input values we can read and then correlate with the relevant outputs.\\n\\nTrain a model that uses these known input-output relationships to predict future, unknown outputs.\\n\\nFigure 2: After learning from labeled tickets, Moveworks’ models can then make predictions about unlabeled data.\\n\\nNeedless to say, supervised learning depends on a historical set of tickets that are accurately labeled. That’s why — before supervised learning begins — Moveworks validates both that the historical tickets have indeed been labeled consistently and that machine learning is the right solution to the problem at hand. In rare cases, we see an erratic distribution of labels for a given field, which prompts us to work with the service desk team to identify the problematic areas and suggest ways to improve the quality of the labels.\\n\\nFinding clarity in context\\n\\nWhile that all sounds straightforward enough, in practice, any individual field of an IT ticket is likely insufficient to determine the proper assignment group on its own. And as the number of fields increases, so too does the complexity of the computations involved. As we saw in Part 1, classical machine learning models were able to read just a few fields and struggled to transform them into useful outputs. Fortunately, the unprecedented computational power of deep learning today enables us to analyze every field of an IT ticket, as well as metadata like the time it was submitted and the department of its author.\\n\\nBut why is that context important? Couldn’t an automated triaging tool assign each ticket to the correct assignment group based on the keywords in their short descriptions, without worrying about other fields or metadata? To answer that question, consider the situation below, where two employees have submitted similar-sounding tickets that classical models would interpret as identical requests. Based on the additional context furnished by the fields Role and Dept, Moveworks recognizes that the sales director’s request belongs in the queue for Salesforce provisioning, while the financial analyst is having an issue with Tableau. It is this difference that makes context indispensable.\\n\\nFigure 3: Historical tickets submitted by employees in the same department help Moveworks differentiate between these requests — facilitating not only ticket routing but also resolution.\\n\\nFrom guesswork to knowledge\\n\\nOf course, the ability to analyze so much contextual ticket data comes with its complications. With this feast of information to digest, how can we hope to separate the signal from the noise? One thing we do know is that human beings are ill-suited for the job. Consuming 50-100 data points, rapidly determining their relevance to a particular IT issue, and then routing that issue to one of hundreds or thousands of assignment groups is overwhelming for service desk agents. Doing all of that in three seconds, meanwhile, is humanly impossible.\\n\\nYet even machine learning models are prone to miss the needle in such an enormous haystack, as we explored in Part 1. Grasping just a single, literal sentence requires is incredibly complex — let alone the task of understanding how that sentence is altered by its broader context. Imagine trying to train an ML model to find the intent of this ticket:\\n\\nFigure 4: A superficial analysis of keywords would probably assign this ticket to the IT Service Desk, as opposed to the Salesforce Admin group where it belongs.\\n\\nTo avoid the problem of information overload, service desk teams trying to automate triaging would have to guess which fields would be the most predictive of the right assignment group, ignoring critical data points. For instance, an ML model that only looked at the short description of the ticket above — ”more problems with browser and settings” — would never discover the employee’s intent: requesting Salesforce access. To find that intent, we must turn to BERT…\\n\\nTransforming words into math\\n\\nWhile understanding language doesn’t come as naturally to machines as it does to us, they compensate for it by being really, really, really good at math. In fact, BERT — a breakthrough technique we use to pre-train natural language understanding (NLU) models — has about 110 million parameters, while a larger version of BERT — fittingly referred to as BERT-Large — has 340 million. That’s slightly more parameters than there are seconds in an entire decade, and it’s almost exactly 340 million more numbers than the average person can remember (we start forgetting beyond seven).\\n\\nThis allows BERT to turn arbitrarily long strings of text into vectors with a standard length — in other words, to convert language into mathematical representations that can be manipulated, analyzed, and categorized. Central to BERT is another fittingly named machine learning concept, “attention,” which focuses the model on semantically important elements of the text, like the direct objects of verbs. Much like the human brain strengthens the connections between neurons that are frequently activated at the same time (“neurons that fire together wire together,” the saying goes), so BERT learns from millions of examples of which words and phrases are most correlated with the desired output, and then assigns them greater weight.\\n\\nConfronted by the complexity of BERT and of deep learning in general, it’s easy to lose sight of the astounding big picture: we can now represent the meaning of a whole sentiment as essentially a single point in space. Of course, even small children can sort individual words along one dimension — say, by ranking foods like “cookie” and “broccoli” according to their sweetness. But mapping passages of text onto 1,024-dimensional hyperspace? That’s big.\\n\\nThe problem with small data\\n\\nDespite these advances, it’s here that we reach perhaps the biggest obstacle standing in the way of automated ticket triage: the small data problem. In Part 1, we established that different companies face different IT challenges, and that machine learning usually isn’t effective without millions of training examples — more than any one service desk can provide. Even techniques as sophisticated as BERT aren’t equipped to learn from the handful of historical IT tickets relating to a particular issue at a particular company.\\n\\nTo overcome the problem of small ticket datasets, we need to augment the data. Moveworks takes a number of approaches to do so, and chief among these is collective learning, which uses tokenized ticket data gathered from many organizations to generate universal insights. Tokenization — the substitution of specific nouns like employee names and software packages with tokens like $PERSON and $SOFTWARE — protects the privacy of each organization while furnishing our ML models with tens of millions of IT tickets, enabling them to approach each new ticket with more “experience” than any human agent could.\\n\\nIn order for this experience to be useful, however, the models must be able to generalize between tickets gathered from different companies by grouping analogous words by meaning. Moveworks does so by transforming the specific words that employees use to describe their IT issues into vectors known as word embeddings — learned representations of text where words that have similar meanings are given similar representations. For example, at Moveworks, we call every employee a “Movester,” so “Movester” would be linked to “Moveworks” in the same way “employee” would be linked to “company.”\\n\\nFigure 5: Understanding the relationships between words allows Moveworks to generalize insights about syntax and semantics, despite the superficial differences between organizations.\\n\\nA new era of IT ticket triage\\n\\nWith ML-powered triage, nearly every ticket is automatically routed, dramatically reducing the total time to resolution. The result has been a gigantic step change for employees and IT professionals alike.\\n\\nFigure 6: Automated ticket triaging is finally a reality — and the technology is only getting better.\\n\\nMachine learning still has ample room to improve in the fast-evolving field of natural language understanding — the most significant breakthroughs to date have occurred in just the last few years. And no matter how advanced ML becomes, some IT tickets may never be resolved without a human touch. The key, then, is to ensure that every one of those tickets, no matter how convoluted, finds itself in exactly the right hands.\\n\\nContact Moveworks to learn more about how our deep learning automates ticket triage.\\n\\nmachine learning\\n\\nnlu\\n\\nit-support\\n\\nticket triage\\n\\ncollective learning\\n\\ntechnology\\n\\nMore blog posts\\n\\nHow to unlock continual service improvement with AIOps\\n      \\n        \\n          Discover how AIOps transforms IT operations from reactive to proactive.

But is it all hype, or are we really standing on the precipice of a transformative era?\\n\\nWe recently sat down with Jason Ballard, Toyota’s Head of IT for North America, to chat through how Toyota is leveraging LLM-powered conversational AI to transform their employee productivity, workplace satisfaction, and enterprise efficiency. During the webinar we talked through the importance of why businesses are embarking on this journey now and the material impact they are seeing to the bottom line.\\n\\nLet's take a step back and explain AI transformation. What does it truly entail, what do companies need to successfully implement it, and what role do copilots play in this new ecosystem?\\n\\nWhat is AI transformation?\\n\\nAI transformation is a strategic paradigm characterized by the integration and deployment of artificial intelligence solutions within a business infrastructure with the objective of enhancing operational efficiency.\\n\\nAt the core of this idea lies the replacement of manual, repetitive tasks with advanced AI systems designed to optimize performance and streamline processes.\\n\\nThe enterprise AI transformation challenge: Employee service is stubbornly people-intensive\\n\\nThe current landscape of employee service is heavily people-intensive, often leaving workers waiting to receive assistance due to lengthy manual processes and uncertainty about where to turn for help.\\n\\nThe good news is that AI is positioned to transform this reality, with huge strides in\\n\\nconversational AI\\n\\n, like\\n\\nGPT-4\\n\\nand other\\n\\nlarge language models\\n\\n, natural language emerging as the new user interface, enabling employees to swiftly and efficiently complete tasks without enduring long waits for support.\\n\\nFigure 1: Right now it takes your employees so long to get help because it’s such a manual process and they don’t know where to go for help.\\n\\nIn fact, AI is already making waves in the enterprise world, enhancing efficiency and yielding tangible results. 80% of the U.S. workforce could have 10% of their tasks affected by LLMs. AI tools, like chatbots, helped boost worker productivity by 14%, helping agents with 2 months of experience perform like those with more than six months of experience.\\n\\nSo it shouldn’t come as a surprise that already 40% of enterprises are already embracing AI or carefully evaluating its potential use cases. This remarkable shift embodies the growing momentum toward fully realizing the incredible advantages AI has to offer in optimizing employee service and expediting operational processes.\\n\\nFigure 2: Enterprises will continue to experiment with AI. According to Bain, 40% of enterprises are already embracing AI or carefully evaluating its potential use cases.\\n\\nWhat's needed for AI transformation?\\n\\nManaging AI transformation for any organization is no small feat. It requires a thoughtful combination of elements designed to work in unison. By focusing on multiple aspects of your organization's structure, you can build a robust AI transformation platform composed of:\\n\\nAnalytics: Monitor performance, evaluate copilot effectiveness, identify opportunities for improvement in both AI systems and human workflows, and pinpoint new areas for AI automation.\\n\\nWorkflow action and authoring: Implement AI-based routing, trigger existing workflows across enterprise systems, optimize business processes, streamline tasks, and create new automated workflows for various purposes.\\n\\nSecurity: Protect infrastructure through data masking, PII scrubbing, hardened security measures, multiple certifications, data residency across continents, and maintain FedRAMP compliance.\\n\\nContent finding and creation: Efficiently search and summarize knowledge, FAQs, documents, and files from multiple sources, and author new content based on existing enterprise data.\\n\\nSuccess plans: Deploy AI-driven joint success plans with prescriptive guidance, and engage in quarterly impact reviews and professional services for optimal AI transformation outcomes.\\n\\nCopilot: Utilize advanced features such as reasoning-based architecture powered by GPT models, fine-tuned LLMs grounded in enterprise data, and domain-specific capabilities (e.g., IT, HR) to enhance AI performance.\\n\\nAdoption: Promote effective communication, adapt to change, provide multilingual support, and integrate AI across various channels like chat platforms, web, and phone support in more than one hundred languages.\\n\\nIntegrations: Establish deep, enterprise-wide connections, including permissions and live ingestion, with every enterprise system, and author new multi-system integrations to make all business workflows more conversational.\\n\\nIt's crucial to understand that copilots, while an essential part of the AI landscape, are just one piece of a much larger puzzle.\\n\\nFigure 3: AI transformation extends beyond AI copilots.\\n\\nIt’s also important to note that merely relying on point solutions, such as chatbot toolkits, standalone LLMs, and single-ecosystem copilots, can lead to disappointment, as they often target small, isolated problems rather than the broader challenges that need to be addressed.\\n\\nIn contrast, a well-rounded AI transformation approach involves strategic integration of copilots with the tools, systems, and products employees use daily.\\n\\nCopilots enhance existing products\\n\\nIt's worth highlighting the value of copilots in the context of AI transformation. Copilots serve as valuable assets designed to improve the products and tools that your employees depend on every day. By harnessing their capabilities, you can further optimize daily processes while ensuring seamless integration with your existing systems.\\n\\nFigure 4: AI copilots are going to enhance the products you and your employees already use on a daily basis.\\n\\nMoreover, the copilot landscape is continually evolving, with new options emerging all the time. It's not unrealistic to envision a future where every system has a copilot tailor-made to enhance its functionality. With constant innovation, copilots are proving to be indispensable components in leading your organization toward a successful AI transformation journey.\\n\\nInformatica,\\n\\nTableau,\\n\\nBox,\\n\\nSlack,\\n\\nAtlassian,\\n\\nMicrosoft,\\n\\nGitHub, and more.\\n\\nWith such significant developments occurring in quick succession, it's safe to assume that soon, every app will boast a copilot designed to enhance its capabilities and deliver transformative results. The future of AI is undeniably bright, signaling a monumental shift in how organizations evolve and interact with technology.\\n\\nSee how Toyota embraced AI transformation with Moveworks\\n\\nAs we stand on the precipice of a transformative era, we can’t ignore the real-life impact this technology is making today. Toyota isn’t. Currently, generative AI is being explored across a variety of domains, from research to call centers and connected vehicles, with the goal of improving employee productivity and enhancing their experience.\\n\\nHere at Moveworks, we offer a custom model, MoveLM™, that’s capable of integrating all your existing systems. harnessing AI transformation for your organization. Developed through years of collaboration, enriched with enterprise-specific data, and stacking best-in-class LLMs, MoveLM™ surpasses its competitors in achieving end-to-end task completion.\\n\\nFor a deeper look, we invite you to watch our webinar with Microsoft, showcasing Toyota's success in boosting productivity and workplace satisfaction through conversational AI and demonstrating how businesses can embrace these innovations and leverage them to drive growth across the organization.\\n\\nAs organizations navigate the rapidly evolving technological landscape, it is essential to understand the role of AI copilots, such as the Moveworks platform, in unlocking the full potential of AI transformation. As we move forward, success stories such as Toyota's will continue to guide us as we explore the future of AI in shaping the way organizations operate.\\n\\nWatch our webinar with Microsoft to learn more about Toyota's AI transformation with Moveworks.

If I want to talk to my friends, I can choose to call them, text them, ping them on WhatsApp or maybe Facebook Messenger, I can email them, or even send them a letter!\\n\\nThere is no single communication channel to rule them all, and there probably never will be, because we’re all a little bit different: we have likes and dislikes, habits, behavioral traits, and experiences that make us unique. And our preferences and styles shift over time, too.\\n\\nSo it should come as no surprise that when an employee is in a moment of need in the workplace — they just got locked out of their account, or their monitor won’t turn on, or they need a license for a new app — they will want to reach out for help through a channel that makes sense to them at that moment in time, for that specific situation, and for that particular issue.\\n\\nFigure 1: IT teams need to support many communications channels\\n\\nAn important factor to consider is that getting help from an IT support team is something most of us do roughly once a month. Sometimes we might go months without an issue, and other months we file a bunch of tickets, all in one go. But on average, it’s a once-a-month thing, and that means that even with the best of intentions, you’ll find it hard to remember about the new “self-service portal” that your IT team rolled out a few months ago, or the “app” they told you about that you forgot to download, or that “walk-up station” that was mentioned in a company newsletter… “What floor is that on again?”\\n\\nChatbots are the new kid on the block when it comes to IT support channels, but the truth is that many chatbots become burdened by the same issues that hurt other channels. If your employees don’t know the chatbot exists, or don’t immediately think of it in their moment of need, it’s going to be a very lonely chatbot. This is why at Moveworks we obsess about making sure the chatbot gives employees results that are so good, they’ll want to return with their next question. It’s why we specialize in the art and the science of driving the adoption of AI-powered chatbots. More on this shortly.\\n\\nMany avenues for employee support\\n\\nWhen we think about the effectiveness of employee support channels, we need to consider two sides of the coin: which channels are best for employees, and which channels are best for IT service desk agents?\\n\\nConsider a good old-fashioned email. For an employee, it’s a great channel, because you can simply type out your issue, fire off an email to the service desk, and then forget about it until someone is ready to help you. But on the IT agent’s side, things are more complicated. The IT agent has the task of parsing the unstructured text of an email, and on top of that, employees are not always super explicit about what they need. If the agent needs to gather more information from the employee, back-and-forth conversations over email (to clarify the request) are notoriously slow.\\n\\nFigure 2: Issues filed and managed via email often suffer delays in resolution\\n\\nAll of this shifts the burden onto the agent. It might be easy for an employee to submit a ticket this way, but the inefficiency of email means it takes a long time for the issue to get fully resolved.\\n\\nThis is why IT teams have been so keen to find alternatives, like self-service portals. Portals looked like a huge opportunity for improving IT efficiency: if only employees had the foresight to use the portal and could correctly self-diagnose their issue, if only they'd find their way to the right form and fill out all the required fields, then the IT team could implement all sorts of workflows, scripts, and automation to handle the rest. Alas, “if only” is the operative term here: truly automated self-service was the theory, but rarely the reality.\\n\\nSo are portals effective?\\n\\nIt’s worth pointing out that\\n\\nsome\\n\\nemployees do use portals. Some even\\n\\nprefer\\n\\nportals. Portals haven’t completely failed enterprise employees. But they aren’t the panacea that many had hoped for. According to the Service Desk Institute,\\n\\nless than 12% of organizations\\n\\nhave realized their anticipated return on investment in self-service portals.\\n\\nFigure 3: As portals become complex, employees find them hard to navigate\\n\\nThe logic behind portals seemed reasonably sound a few years ago. It went something like this: Amazon.com is really popular for shopping; people must love the Amazon UI experience; therefore, let’s create an “Amazon-like” web UI for IT support. And so, creating an “Amazon-like” employee experience became the mantra of many IT support teams building out portals.\\n\\nHowever, there are some flaws in this logic.\\n\\nFirst, only a small portion of people actually shop through an Amazon-like experience. Even today, Amazon represents only 5% of the retail market in the US. Even the entire e-commerce category accounts for just 14% of retail sales. So while some people do like the Amazon experience, most people still prefer to go to a physical store. Old habits die hard, in both retail and IT support.\\n\\nSecond, there is a big contextual difference between shopping and getting help. When you’re sitting down to browse an online store, you’re probably pretty relaxed; you’re up for reading a few reviews, looking at some suggested alternatives, and enjoying the whole shopping experience. But when you need urgent support, things are a little different. Imagine you’ve just been involved in a car accident. Would you want to navigate to a web page and identify which service you require, select the most relevant incident type, and then fill out a form to provide details? Or would you prefer to call the emergency services, tell them what happened, and have them figure out the best course of action? Probably the latter. In a moment of need, you want to shift the burden onto somebody else (an expert) as quickly as possible.\\n\\nOf course, your computer crashing isn’t as serious as your car crashing. But it’s important to understand the difference in mindset of someone who needs help compared with someone who needs new shoes. It’s a different experience.\\n\\nThere are more things to consider here:\\n\\nInfrequent use: When employees have only one IT support issue a month, it’s difficult to instill a new ticket filing habit. How do you get them to bookmark a portal URL in their browser? Do they need to be on the VPN to use it? How do you get them to make the mental connection between having an IT issue and navigating to the portal?\\n\\nSteep learning curve: Portals are like filing systems. The IT team creates menus, sub-menus, and navigation structures to help employees find a relevant form. But portals are typically organized the way IT teams think they should be organized, and this doesn’t always make sense to employees. For example, the following series of menus and forms makes logical sense: Hardware Request > AV Equipment > Accessory Request Form. But if I need an HDMI cable for my monitor, there’s a good chance I’ll never discover this form; after all, from my perspective, I want an HDMI cable, not an Accessory.\\n\\nGeneric Requests: Most portals include a “Generic Request” form, which employees can fill out if they haven’t found (or can’t be bothered to look for) a more specific form. Generic request forms typically include fields for a short description and long description. The resulting tickets look pretty similar to what you’d get via an email: highly unstructured, free-form text. We’ve seen companies where as many as 80% (!) of form completions through the portal are generic request forms; for a typical company, about 50% of form completions are generic requests. The prevalence of unstructured, generic requests defeats the entire purpose of IT support portals. We’ll share some data on this in future posts.\\n\\nGrowing cost: Portals require a lot of maintenance. You have to update the form titles and descriptions, the images and workflows, the automations and integrations, the UI, the navigational structure, and so on. The initial build-out of a portal can easily take several months, and later, continuous management and maintenance usually require a dedicated team.\\n\\nSupporting employees where they are and when they need help\\n\\nWhen thinking about the relevancy and efficiency of channels, it’s important to understand the wider context of IT support communications beyond just filing tickets.\\n\\nConsider a few common scenarios in IT support:\\n\\nan IT agent reaches out to an employee to clarify an ambiguity in a ticket the employee just filed;\\n\\nan IT agent reaches out to inform an employee that their request for a new software license requires a manager's approval; or\\n\\nIT proactively notifies employees because a system alert has identified an issue that affects them.\\n\\nMany of these scenarios require two-way, back-and-forth communication, which is why enterprise messaging platforms are becoming increasingly popular as a support channel.\\n\\nWhen an employee needs help\\n\\nBeing human, employees want an easy way of requesting help. Until recently, most employees would choose email or chatting with a live agent. Now, with enterprise chat quickly becoming the predominant way for employees to get work done, a growing number of employees prefer to engage with the IT team over chat. A statistic from Slack illustrates this point: 87% of Slack’s enterprise chat users say that chat messaging improves communication and collaboration in their organization.\\n\\nWhen an IT issue needs the employee’s attention\\n\\nOften an employee’s input is needed to resolve an issue. If you've just requested a new monitor, but forgot to mention what size monitor you need, then the service desk agent will add a comment to the ticket asking you which size to order. This comment generates an email, but you don't notice it in your inbox for a few days. There's a better way. A modern support system must be able to reach out to the employee in a way that gets their attention instantly and without wasting their time.\\n\\nEnterprise chat offers the solution for this. An average of 60-70% of employees are active on their enterprise chat platform each week, and that number is growing steadily. That makes chat a great way to contact the employee when the IT team needs information to help resolve the issue, or just to update the employee on progress.\\n\\nBest of all, it doesn't matter what channel the issue originated in. Even for an issue that started out as an email, a reach-out over chat will usually get a faster response from the employee.\\n\\nWhen IT detects a problem that the employee should know about\\n\\nA well-instrumented IT environment often knows about an issue before the affected employee is aware of it. For example, IT knows the minute an employee has exceeded the limit of failed login attempts and been locked out. In this case, a quick chat message from IT can save hours of time for the employee.\\n\\nFigure 4: IT systems can reach out to employees to alert them about issues\\n\\nLikewise, the IT team wants to be able to alert employees in advance of planned downtimes and migrations. Here, too, the IT team can reach affected employees over chat before trouble has a chance to happen.\\n\\nIntercepting issues across channels\\n\\nThe cases we outlined above seem wide-ranging — when an employee needs a fast way to ask for help; when an employee has filed a ticket, but now the agent needs more information; and when IT needs to inform the employee about an issue — but what they have in common is a need to work across many channels with a minimum of burden on the employee and agent. This demands a system that can inform itself of issues across a wide range of channels, and respond appropriately.\\n\\nAnd that's what Moveworks has built. We've addressed this by building an AI platform that can intercept tickets across the board, seamlessly, through its integrations with other enterprise platforms. There is no new app for employees to install or portal for IT to maintain. Moveworks simply plugs into an organization’s existing infrastructure. Because Moveworks is accessible as a chatbot in enterprise chat, it’s nearly effortless for employees to ask for help. They simply type their questions or describe their issues using everyday language. Moveworks takes care of the rest and resolves the issues completely, often in just a few seconds.\\n\\nWhy chat is powerful for IT communication\\n\\nEnterprise chat platforms fill a void left in the patchwork of IT-related communications that happen via phone, email, portals, and walk-up counters. A majority of employees now spend their day communicating over enterprise chat, so they’re quick to embrace an IT bot on that platform. Chat platforms are built for fast, lightweight communication, which is essential for fast IT support: employees tend to read and respond quickly to IT reach-outs over chat, regardless of whether they’re currently using their laptop or mobile device.\\n\\nTo see how this plays out in an organization that's quickly adopting chat as its main IT support channel, see the guest post from Stanley Toh, Head of Enterprise End-User Experience & Services at Broadcom. Toh talks about how his team has driven chat adoption for IT help and explains that employees have embraced chat-based support so fully that he expects to turn off telephone-based support soon for L1 issues.\\n\\nOther relevant case studies include:\\n\\nBroadcom takes on new challenges and new employees, helped by a new AI solution\\n\\nMedallia finds success and satisfaction with Moveworks\\n\\nNutanix gets rapid results using AI for IT support\\n\\nchatbot\\n\\nit-support\\n\\nportal\\n\\nproduct features\\n\\nMore blog posts\\n\\nHow to unlock continual service improvement with AIOps\\n      \\n        \\n          Discover how AIOps transforms IT operations from reactive to proactive.

Moveworks has been certified under ISO 27001.\\n\\nISO 27001 is a leading global standard for building a secure organization — one that guards both its corporate and customer assets against loss and unauthorized use. For Moveworks to become certified, an independent audit firm rigorously reviewed our approach to protecting the integrity of our organization and systems, as well as our measures to guard the confidentiality of the customer data with which we’ve been entrusted. In short, our ISO 27001 certification shows that Moveworks follows industry-leading practices to keep your information safe and to react effectively at the first sign of a security issue.\\n\\nISO 27001 certification marks a significant step in the security and compliance component of the Moveworks service, which has been integral to our company’s DNA from the very beginning. Most organizations take years to get certified — often overhauling their entire digital infrastructure in the process. But Moveworks managed to earn its certification just ten months after coming out of stealth mode, in large part because we’d structured not only our technical infrastructure but also our organization as a whole for robust security.\\n\\nAI security culture\\n\\nAt a time when security breaches have become so frequent that we take them for granted, Moveworks views data protection as the critical foundation of our digital world. We believe that those who use online services should have the confidence to assume data privacy is a given — not a new source of risk. That’s why every single Moveworks employee and contractor undergoes comprehensive security training, while our leadership ensures all team members adhere to the Moveworks Information Security Management System, which enumerates internationally accepted best practices for data protection.\\n\\nIn addition, we’ve embraced several measures to comply with stringent data protection laws like GDPR and CCPA: for example, we grant data access only to those employees who need it and retain customer data for a limited time. Security is a primary consideration in every decision we make — not just for our technical teams but across the company — because businesses simply cannot succeed without the trust of their customers.\\n\\nAI security architecture\\n\\nThe same logic applies to our array of best-in-class controls that ensure the confidentiality and integrity of customer data at all access points, since no digital infrastructure is immune to human error and malicious cyber-attacks. Sensitive information — including customer conversations, system keys, and tokens — is encrypted in transit and at rest. Moveworks stores encryption keys securely and rotates them periodically.\\n\\nWhen it comes to our internal technology stack, we institute mandatory two-factor authentication for all employees on all applications where it is supported. And before deciding to implement a new third-party cloud service, we assess the type of data that would be stored there, as well as that vendor’s security practices to ensure they meet our high standards.\\n\\nAI security readiness\\n\\nMoveworks’ security readiness and vulnerability management efforts span our product lifecycle, from security-focused design reviews to external and internal security testing. During the product planning and design phase, we consider the potential security risks associated with each product or feature, including enhancements to our product’s cloud environment or a new system integration. We conduct biannual, third-party penetration tests and vulnerability scans on all such changes to our technology — always with an eye on eliminating risk and reinforcing our defenses against likely attack vectors.\\n\\nMoveworks provides clear communication and fast handling of security events, as set forth in the Moveworks Incident Response Policy. Our state-of-the-art security stack detects potential incidents, allowing the Moveworks security team to respond quickly. We continuously evaluate our procedures and systems to keep pace with changes in the threat landscape.\\n\\nAn ongoing journey\\n\\nRunning a secure service has been a top focus of the Moveworks leadership and team since the company was founded, and we're pleased to have achieved ISO 27001 certification quickly as a result. But while this milestone validates our commitment to the integrity of the processes, people, and technology that power our machine learning platform, it has only inspired us to accelerate our security-related efforts moving forward.\\n\\nIndeed, getting ISO 27001 certified was just one of many pit stops on the security roadmap we created early on in our company’s journey. Among the future goals on that roadmap are SOC 2 compliance — Type 1 and Type 2 — as well as compliance with sector-specific regulations like HIPAA and FedRAMP.\\n\\nThank you for your continued support.

Unfortunately, the challenges of working remotely have made supporting a productive workforce more difficult than ever. With employees unable to collaborate in person or get troubleshooting help at a physical walk-up bar, our IT team needed to transition the company to a fully digital workplace.\\n\\nFor us, that workplace was Microsoft Teams. Given its tight integrations with our existing collaboration tools, we recognized the potential of Teams to become a unified hub for teamwork. The task then became encouraging employees who haven’t used enterprise messaging tools to adopt a whole new way of working. That’s where Moveworks was critical: The Moveworks bot not only fixes our employees’ IT issues instantly, straight to Teams, it also organically drives new employees to the Teams platform.\\n\\nAll roads lead to Microsoft Teams\\n\\nWhether you’re starting a diet or switching to an unfamiliar workflow, breaking habits is hard. Leaders should expect resistance when rolling out new technologies, both from hesitant employees and from naysayers whose instinct is to oppose change. So when we set out to get the entire company onto Microsoft Teams, we knew we needed to take a proactive and comprehensive approach.\\n\\nWith Moveworks, we’ve managed to implement that approach successfully. In fact, just four months into our promotion campaign for Moveworks on Teams, we’ve seen a roughly 6X increase in Teams’ adoption companywide:\\n\\nFigure 1:\\n\\nAdoption of Moveworks on Teams has continued to increase,\\n\\nthanks to our ongoing promotional campaign.\\n\\nPrior to working remotely full-time, most employees at Robert Half relied on conventional communication channels like email. The shift to remote work exacerbated the problems with these channels, since waiting hours or days for a response over email is even more of a drag on productivity when you can’t meet face-to-face. Microsoft Teams, on the other hand, is fundamentally interactive and location-agnostic, making it the ideal virtual workplace.\\n\\nMoveworks has accelerated the switch to that virtual workplace by making all roads lead to Teams. No matter where employees ask for IT help or pose questions about company policy, Moveworks intercepts the request and resolves it directly on the Teams platform — gently nudging them toward the most efficient pathway to productivity. And by receiving instant support from the Moveworks bot, these employees remember to come back to Teams the next time they need help.\\n\\nCreating a one-stop shop for instant answers\\n\\nClearly demonstrating the value of new tools to employees is crucial. To invest time and effort into learning how to use something new, employees need to understand why it is an improvement — and why the existing model, such as sending emails, is broken.\\n\\nMoving away from conventional channels like email meant rethinking how our IT team communicates critical information to our employees. Rather than firing off a mass email that will likely get lost in the inbox, Moveworks lets us send targeted broadcast messages directly on Teams. The result is that employees are more likely to get eyes on the content and respond accordingly.\\n\\nFigure 2: Moveworks allows us to send key updates to employees on Teams.\\n\\nIt is important to note that these broadcast messages are interactive. So, if an employee has follow-up questions, they can ask the Moveworks bot directly. And not just questions about the broadcast. Through the bot, employees can learn more about the Teams platform, get troubleshooting help, or read more about company policies.\\n\\nNot only does this interaction method 1) bring new users on to Teams and 2) enable them to better leverage the platform, it also 3) demonstrates the value of Teams in making work happen faster. People are willing to stick around when a new technology has an unmistakable and positive impact on their work.\\n\\nEmbracing an AI-powered workplace in 2020\\n\\nWith our rapid adoption of Microsoft Teams, we have already started to see a substantial transformation in the way we get work done here at Robert Half.\\n\\nFor employees, Microsoft Teams facilitates real-time communication, getting everyone on the same page. With Moveworks on Teams, getting IT support takes seconds. But critically, these tools have also allowed our IT team to work more efficiently, as well. Rather than reading through all of the support requests submitted via email, the Moveworks bot instantly resolves many issues without any input from the service desk, which was especially important given the influx of basic support tickets early on in the transition to remote work.\\n\\nFigure 3:\\n\\nMoveworks provides real-time IT support, automatically tracking and resolving issues,\\n\\neven for employees working from home.\\n\\nNow, Moveworks is resolving a growing portion of our tickets across many use cases, but there will always be tickets that AI can't resolve — that's where we lean heavily on Moveworks Triage to help get the right issues to the right assignment groups accurately and instantly. 60% of our service desk actions are more complex and require input from subject-matter experts. The conventional model of email and manually sorting through everything that comes into the support desk is time-intensive. Now with Moveworks, 70% of all IT issues that need to be reassigned are automatically handled by Moveworks Triage.\\n\\nAcross the board, we’ve embraced a model that is AI-powered. We wanted Robert Half to be a more networked, more connected company. To do this, we had to change the way our employees interacted with one another. Deploying the appropriate technology, like Teams, helped tremendously.\\n\\nAfter launching our internal Moveworks bot, groups that had once resisted this type of virtual collaboration for years began to engage meaningfully with their colleagues. Adoption of Teams grew exponentially in just a couple months, and our IT team hasn’t broken its stride with the surge in support tickets from increased remote work. It’s safe to say that we are well on our way to a full-fledged virtual workplace in tune with the needs of the modern employee.\\n\\nFigure 4:\\n\\nMoveworks automatically surfaces relevant knowledge base articles\\n\\nto answer employee questions directly in Teams.\\n\\nContact  Moveworks to learn how AI can supercharge your workforce productivity.\\n\\nnews\\n\\nMore blog posts\\n\\nHow to unlock continual service improvement with AIOps\\n      \\n        \\n          Discover how AIOps transforms IT operations from reactive to proactive.

After all, employees aren’t expected to be IT experts. They’re expected to focus on their increasingly demanding work, and when an IT issue gets in the way, they contact an IT agent to report the symptoms they’re seeing. A great agent listens, understands what the employee is reporting, and resolves the issue or guides them towards rapid resolution.\\n\\nThe challenge of scale\\n\\nScaling a great agent is a herculean task. With a limited number of agents, the unavoidable reality is that bottlenecks arise — agents have limited bandwidth to understand and know everything — especially given that enterprises today run hundreds of cloud applications and distributed systems across a range of commoditized hardware and operating systems.\\n\\nIn order to scale IT service while controlling costs and improving reliability, enterprises have implemented processes that help prioritize issues and route them to the most suitable agent or group. IT uses a set of service level agreements (SLAs), as well as metrics like First Contact Resolution (FCR), First Time Right (FTR), and Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR), to ensure that the quality and speed of service doesn’t degrade beyond acceptable levels.\\n\\nLarge IT service desks have become more coordinated thanks to the IT processes and underlying workflow systems they’ve implemented, but the results for employees haven’t been as good. For employees, these systems often fail to provide fast, high-quality IT service. IT ticketing systems are good at helping agents move tickets into queues where service desk agents serve as nodes, but ticketing systems don’t actually resolve issues themselves. As a consequence, great employee experience, characterized by instant resolution of employees’ issues, has remained elusive.\\n\\nProviding rapid service at scale\\n\\nOver the past decades, there have been many attempts to find technology solutions to this problem of slow employee support. Unfortunately, many technologies deployed to help employees find answers or resolve issues have failed to live up to the promise.\\n\\nIT portals and workplace automations remain elusive destinations for employees, ones they often can’t remember or access easily — and when they do, they have a hard time navigating them. They are confronted with a slew of buttons and widgets — few of which make much sense to the employee. For example, if you need access to a folder for your project, would that be a service, or a request, or an incident? Turns out, it’s buried under “Request → Active Directory → Modify AD group permissions,” which only a small number of employees are likely to know.\\n\\nWhen it comes to searching for answers, search in enterprise knowledge systems is underwhelming. IT teams often resort to hiring people to augment knowledge articles with keywords to help surface relevant results for employees. In practice, these techniques don’t work because employees describe their issues with symptoms. Instead of saying “what’s the process for getting a loaner laptop,” they will say “I accidentally spilled orange juice on my keyboard.”\\n\\nThe goal of the IT portal was to give employees a platform where they could find an answer to their question or fulfill a request — without any intervention from an IT service desk agent. But even if employees discover and navigate to the portal, if they only understand the symptoms of their issue — and not the resolution — they’ll most likely resort to creating a ticket or calling the service desk so they can get help figuring out the right next steps.\\n\\nYou can see this failure when you look at portal adoption and ticket-filing statistics. It’s rare to see enterprises where more than 20% of tickets originate in a self-service portal. Adoption just hasn’t proved to be strong enough. What’s interesting is that even for tickets filed through a self-service form, the majority of these are “Generic Request” forms that have no specific data collection or automation tied to them. They are just another type of free-form ticket that agents will have to triage by hand. The bottom line is that agents are still in the critical path.\\n\\nRelieve the burden, don’t shift it\\n\\nPortals were an effort to quickly scale IT services while improving speed of service, but the net effect only moved the burden of understanding issues from agents to employees; it didn’t materially impact resolution times.\\n\\nIf we want to accelerate service, the first step is to understand each issue immediately when it\\'s reported — delays in resolution are usually the result of tickets waiting in queues for agents to interpret them. Doing this requires a system that provides natural language understanding (NLU). Ideally, NLU takes the form of a chatbot embedded in an enterprise-wide chat platform (like Microsoft Teams, Slack, Google Hangouts Chat, and others), one that employees already use regularly to chat with other employees — which makes discoverability and access super easy. These two abilities — understanding IT issues as reported by employees, and having follow-on conversations with employees — are at the core of the Moveworks platform.\\n\\n\"To accelerate service, the first step is to understand each issue immediately, and this requires a system that provides NLU.\"\\n\\nNLU goes deeper than the natural language processing approaches that have long been used to identify types of words and sentences. NLU techniques get to the heart of what the employee is saying when they chat with the service desk bot or file a ticket with IT. In order to do this, these techniques consider the employees’ organizational context and combine it with domain understanding to successfully interpret IT issues at extremely high levels of precision and coverage.\\n\\nSupport across multiple channels\\n\\nThe harsh reality of rolling out a new IT service chatbot is that changing employee behavior is hard. Even if you deploy the world\\'s best chatbot, many employees won\\'t know the chatbot is available to serve them, and they certainly won’t change their habits right away. There are many channels where employees go to ask for help: they file IT tickets, they post to a group channel in Slack or Teams, or they email the support desk. With all these ways to get help, it\\'s absolutely critical that an AI resolution platform be able interpret requests that comes in through any channel.\\n\\nOnce a platform interprets the issue, it might need more information from an employee to further diagnose the issue or resolve it upon confirmation from the employee. To provide instant service, the conversational AI system should be able to find employees where they are (for example, in their enterprise chat) and engage them to resolve their issue fully. Through conversation, the system can seek confirmation, clarify the request, ask follow-on questions, and even request approvals.\\n\\nEmployees set a high bar for conversation quality\\n\\nA conversational chatbot can only help the organization scale if employees embrace it, and this can only happen if the chatbot provides a natural flow of conversation leading to quick resolution. The unfortunate state of many chatbots today is that when employees interact with them, the experience is poor. The employee gets the feeling the conversation is going nowhere, and they give up trying to chat with the bot. Good conversation is fluid, doesn\\'t get stuck in loops, and gives the conversation partners the feeling they\\'re being understood. If the chatbot responds confusingly when it can’t understand a request, or if the system gives a response that’s clearly wrong, the employee will lose trust in the system and may revert to their old practice of picking up the phone to call an agent or filing tickets.\\n\\nOn the other hand, if the chatbot provides consistently useful results, employees will quickly adopt it as their go-to resource for solving problems. Our experience at Moveworks shows that once employees gain confidence in the bot, they also begin to chat with it for smaller issues they might have otherwise left unaddressed, like overdue software upgrades and license renewals. The round-the-clock, easy availability of a chatbot encourages this adoption pattern—often eliminating employee pain that enterprises didn’t even know existed.\\n\\nFinding the best resolution path\\n\\nTo provide consistently good help, an NLU system must learn from both the language employees use to describe their issues and from the range of resolution paths that are available to it. In other words, even a precise understanding of the issue description doesn’t help if the system can’t return the best answer or resolution for the issue.\\n\\nIT support needs to be easily accessible\\n\\nEmployees run into IT issues regularly, but generally they don’t encounter the same issue over and over again. In other words, when an employee has a problem, it’s usually a problem that’s new to them. This means they probably don’t know where to go or what to do in order to resolve it. It’s unrealistic to expect that employees have expert-level knowledge in the IT systems they need help with, or remember how to access elusive destinations like the IT portal page. The right approach is to build systems that understand their pain as they express it in symptomatic language.\\n\\nThe reality of employees’ pain is best represented by the following characteristics:\\n\\nThey need help infrequently: typically 1-2 times a month. As a result, they rightly don’t want to spend time learning how to access and navigate portals.\\n\\nThey’re unable to connect their symptoms to an available resolution path. The path to resolution is wide and varied, and it\\'s unrealistic to expect the employee to know these paths. The possible paths to resolution can range from following instructions in a knowledge article, to changing permissions in a security group, to installing desktop applications.\\n\\nEven if they get past the first two hurdles, they’re not authorized to modify underlying systems and have to wait for IT service desk teams to provide the last mile of service.\\n\\nTo relieve employee pain, a good AI resolution platform will understand symptomatic language, choose the right resolution path, and resolve the issue immediately or show the employee how to resolve it. If a manager or system owner needs to approve the resolution (for example, when the employee is asking for a new software license), the AI resolution platform should have the ability to reach out to approvers over chat and get an immediate decision, while keeping the employee apprised of the task’s status.\\n\\n\"The right approach to IT resolution is to build systems that understand employees\\' pain as they express it in symptomatic language.\"\\n\\nThe future of IT support is conversational\\n\\nConversational user interfaces are the way employees will interact with IT and other corporate services. Here’s why:\\n\\nEmployees get the simplicity they want. Navigation is easier because the chat interface eliminates complexity. Employees just describe their problems in a few words or sentences; no more hunting for forms and clicking buttons.\\n\\nDiscovery becomes effortless. If the employee doesn’t know where to go to resolve their issues, the chatbot reaches out to them to help them out. To do this, a good resolution system scans incoming support tickets and uses its NLU to understand them. For each ticket that has an automated resolution path available, the system contacts the employee over enterprise messaging and offers them an immediate resolution, all without involving a service desk agent.\\n\\nThe IT interface for employees becomes future-proof. Over time, more features in an IT service portal mean more tabs and fields, resulting in an unusable portal. With a conversational interface, even as you add features, it remains easy to use. All an employee has to do is punch out a few words to describe their issue.\\n\\nStay tuned\\n\\nStay tuned for our next post in which we’ll dive into why NLU is a hard problem and how a well-engineered NLU system can handle it in the context of IT service delivery.\\n\\nTo learn more about how our customers are using Moveworks, take a look at our case studies:\\n\\nAutodesk HelpBot: Quick answers bring quick adoption\\n\\nBroadcom takes on new challenges and new employees, helped by a new AI solution\\n\\nNutanix gets rapid results using AI for IT support\\n\\nnlu\\n\\nlanguage\\n\\nchatbot\\n\\nit-support\\n\\nscaling\\n\\nconversational\\n\\nportal\\n\\ntechnology\\n\\nMore blog posts\\n\\nHow to unlock continual service improvement with AIOps\\n      \\n        \\n          Discover how AIOps transforms IT operations from reactive to proactive.

As AI copilots continue to evolve with enhanced capabilities and deeper integration into enterprise ecosystems, they hold the potential to redefine the way businesses operate and compete in the coming years.\\n\\nWhat is an enterprise AI copilot?\\n\\nAn enterprise copilot is a fluid conversational interface that connects your employees with every business system. It’s built on hundreds of machine learning models, fine-tuned to your enterprise data. Available across every channel and fluent in more than one hundred languages, your enterprise copilot makes it easier than ever for your employees to get things done.\\n\\nFigure 1: Available across every channel and fluent in more than one hundred languages, your enterprise copilot makes it easier than ever for your employees to get things done.\\n\\nWhy is an enterprise AI copilot needed?\\n\\nAs businesses become increasingly complex and rely on a myriad of software solutions, employees often face the challenge of navigating and managing diverse systems. Traditional, isolated solutions often fall short of resolving cross-system communication problems, that may lead to reduced productivity and inefficiencies. An enterprise AI copilot is the answer to overcoming these challenges.\\n\\nBy integrating all enterprise systems under a single conversational interface, employees can access information and complete tasks more efficiently. The AI copilot simplifies collaboration, making it easier for employees to excel in their functions and significantly boosting overall productivity.\\n\\nHow do AI copilots work\\n\\nAI copilots have strong foundations built on two essential components: artificial intelligence and integrations across systems.\\n\\nAI algorithms applied in natural language processing, context understanding, and machine learning enable copilots to predict user needs and provide informed suggestions. Through integrations, AI copilots can interact with a vast range of systems, creating a unified, interconnected platform for seamless communication and task management.\\n\\nWhen trying to understand how AI copilots work, it’s important to take note of the four-tiered AI copilot strategy framework in order to understand its strengths and limitations.\\n\\nTier-one AI copilots leverage basic API calls to LLMs as the main part of their AI infrastructure. This allows for an easy lift and low barrier to entry. While these copilots offer lots of general information, they lack domain-specific knowledge, which can lead to hallucinations.\\n\\nTier-two AI copilots involve a customized implementation of a fine-tuned LLM grounded in an organization’s data. While this is a slightly higher lift, the outputs are more customized to the organization and improve security and privacy. They are limited to single-step use cases and can get limited performance due to relying on a single LLMs outputs.\\n\\nTier-three AI copilots involve chaining multiple LLMs together, creating sophisticated pipelines optimized for multi-step use cases that leverage the strengths and capabilities of each LLM involved. In this way, tier-three AI copilots can tackle a broader range of use cases, enhance productivity and efficiency, and address challenges in more sophisticated domains.\\n\\nTier-four AI copilots work to address the challenges inherent in providing extensible employee support and facilitating autonomous decision-making. As a sophisticated LLM system specifically designed for enterprise-wide deployment, these tier-four copilots encompass advanced features like a reasoning engine, analytics, security, and privacy, as well as out-of-the-box connectors catering to the demanding requirements of large organizations.\\n\\nThe performance and functional difference between a tier-one and tier-four AI copilot is staggering, which is why enterprise AI copilots fall into the latter category. They require a sizable investment in capital, personnel, advanced understanding of key machine learning techniques, and a deeply integrated platform that spans the entire enterprise ecosystem.\\n\\nBenefits of AI copilots\\n\\nAI copilots offer a wide array of benefits that alleviate common challenges faced by employees, agents, and system developers alike. By streamlining navigation and consolidating resources, users can quickly access required information, considerably reducing the time spent on tedious searches.

Their primary role is facilitating interactions, answering FAQs, and providing support in areas like customer service, e-commerce, and lead generation. In some cases, AI chatbots can be pre-programmed to handle specific scenarios and limited in terms of learning and adaptation abilities.\\n\\nVirtual agents\\n\\nVirtual agents leverage a mix of programmed rules and\\xa0conversational AI\\xa0in order to offer a simple service or provide basic help. Virtual agents are a larger category of online services, containing chatbots, voice bots, and even interactive voice response systems.\\n\\nAlthough virtual agents, chatbots, and AI are often used interchangeably, it is important to note that a virtual agent and a chatbot are similar but not the same. The term chatbot refers to a specific type of virtual assistant designed to communicate via chat, such as email or messaging.\\xa0Virtual agents, on the other hand, can communicate through any given medium\\xa0— for example, via voice response over the phone. Virtual agents are used in diverse domains, including customer support, sales, and technical assistance.\\n\\nTo be succinct — AI copilots, AI chatbots, and virtual agents each offer varying levels of functionality and sophistication. To select the appropriate tool for your business, carefully consider your operational needs, required level of user assistance, and the ability to learn and adapt to your organization's specific context.\\n\\nThe future of AI copilots\\n\\nAs AI copilots continue to improve and evolve, collaboration between humans and machines will become even more seamless, leading to greater productivity and enhanced problem-solving capabilities.\\n\\nBy bridging the gap between various enterprise systems and offering contextually relevant assistance to users, AI copilots serve as powerful allies in the modern, fast-paced business environment.\\n\\nAs you consider implementing an AI copilot for your organization, it's essential to understand its distinctive features, the value it can bring to your operations, and how it differs from other AI-driven solutions, such as chatbots and virtual agents.\\n\\nUltimately, the key to harnessing the full potential of AI copilots lies in selecting a platform that aligns with your organization's unique requirements and is built on robust security, scalability, and learning capabilities.\\n\\nBy choosing the right AI copilot, an organization can fuel its growth, transform its operations and ensure a smoother, more productive journey for both employees and customers.\\n\\nLearn how to build your AI copilot strategy.\\n\\nnlu\\n\\nbest practices\\n\\nMore blog posts\\n\\nHow to unlock continual service improvement with AIOps\\n      \\n        \\n          Discover how AIOps transforms IT operations from reactive to proactive.

Yes, and why generative AI is the future.\\n\\nBhavin Shah, CEO and Founder\\n\\nJanuary 17, 2023\\n\\nlinkedin\\n\\nfacebook\\n\\ntwitter\\n\\nemail\\n\\nChatGPT isn’t just a seminal moment in AI history; it’s a seminal moment in human history. It’s fair to say that the biggest change to the Internet since crypto just happened.\\n\\nA lot of new technology sneaks up on you slowly. By the time it arrives, it\\'s normalized — or, at worst, fails to live up to the hype. Think: Google Glass, 3D TVs, or the Segway. Each of these innovations entered the scene with much fanfare but didn’t quite hit the mark.\\n\\nChatGPT is different than these other innovations. It almost came out of the blue.\\n\\nBefore November 2022, large language models (LLMs) were relegated to Ph.D. dissertations and niche Substacks. Launching ChatGPT was an ingenious way to make the incredibly powerful LLM technology available for anyone interested in experimenting.\\n\\nPresenting itself as an easy-to-use chat interface, you can ask ChatGPT literally any question that comes to mind, and the results are nothing short of incredibly engaging and creative content. Unless you happened to stumble upon a random person at a coffee shop wearing Google Glass or enjoyed a Segway tour on vacation, you never had the opportunity to experience the genuinely transformative tech behind these products. With ChatGPT, all you need is a WiFi connection.\\n\\nSince ChatGPT launched, it has continued to give everyone who’s played around with it a sense of wonderment. And what’s even cooler is that this is only the beginning. This instant chat interface is just one of the potentially infinite number of applications for large language models.\\n\\nAs someone who’s been at the forefront of conversational AI for years now, it’s rare that a chatbot blows me away. ChatGPT is, in fact, very good at what it can do. The last time I recall being impressed by a consumer AI was Amazon’s Alexa, but it’s turned into a platform for telling jokes or occasionally ordering some groceries.\\n\\nThere\\'s a lot of excitement surrounding ChatGPT, but the question remains: Does it have staying power?\\n\\nThe human-AI partnership has great potential\\n\\nTo me — what makes ChatGPT so captivating are its generative abilities. The output is decent. It sounds similar to a high schooler and is more than capable of writing a standard five-paragraph essay — a fact that hasn’t gone unnoticed by teachers everywhere. Would it pass the Turing Test? Maybe. Could it write something akin to Faulkner’s The Sound and the Fury? Probably not.\\n\\nBut could a person and ChatGPT write the next great classic together? That’s where this all gets very interesting. AI has never been able to make something great on its own; someone had to make it happen. That’s the root of what’s called the \"zero to one\" problem, referring to the challenge of taking an idea or concept that does not yet exist and bringing it into reality, without simply copying or iterating on something that already exists.\\n\\nAs demonstrated by ChatGPT, generative AI could potentially facilitate a partnership between people and AI in solving this \"zero to one\" problem by helping people expand upon their own ideas or concepts and serving as the starting point for a solution. By working together in this way, a person and AI could identify and explore new ideas that might not have been discovered otherwise and work to bring those ideas into reality. Software has been unable to solve the \"zero to one\" problem because it worked for us. But generative AI works with us.\\n\\nThis partnership is the next step in software. Generative AI is a new level of human-machine partnership. It turns deep learning engines into collaborators capable of creating new content\\xa0nearly like a human would. We now have high-quality, readily-available, fast AI models for generating text, images, videos, software code, music, voice, 3D models, and more — none of which is copyrighted or plagiarized. And ChatGPT’s conversational interface has proven it’s possible for anyone to share their vision.\\n\\nWe need to navigate generative AI’s limitations\\n\\nChatGPT isn’t exactly something that emerged from nowhere on November 30, 2022. Other technologies have leveraged natural language generation (NLG), which was first used commercially in the 1990s.\\n\\nMore recently, GitHub’s Copilot — an AI that helps programmers write code in real time — was launched a couple of months before ChatGPT, resulting in similar media buzz. More than six months in now, it’s being used, but it hasn’t really caught up with the launch day hype that it was going to completely change how engineers write code. This is to say, we shouldn’t make the foregone conclusion that ChatGPT will transform everything overnight.\\n\\nMy point is that there is a lot of amazing tech that can be powerful, but it just existing isn’t enough. Some community participation is needed from us to make it powerful. ChatGPT will need to be solutioned in a way that addresses its limitations before it becomes something meaningful.\\n\\nTo call out just one complexity, GPT-3.5, the model that ChatGPT pulls from, has been known for its tendency to generate false statements in a phenomenon called \"hallucination.\" Much like a good storyteller, this model has its way of taking what they have learned and reshaping it into something new — with no regard for whether it is true. ChatGPT has a 21% hallucination rate, and that will need to be addressed before it’s consistently useful.\\n\\nWith GPT-4 — and likely a half dozen other LLMs — on the horizon, we’re going to have to scratch our heads and figure out how to harness the capabilities of something like ChatGPT before declaring it the end all be all. Because, people don\\'t want abstract technology; they want a product that has utility. They want something they can use to make their lives better.\\n\\nChatGPT is just the beginning. Generative AI is here to stay.\\n\\nWe already know that ideas are cheap and execution is hard. Every aspiring entrepreneur can have an idea for a business, but actually getting a company off the ground and making it successful takes more than that idea.\\n\\nIt used to be that anyone who wanted to share their ideas with the world had to take their work to a publisher. The internet changed the landscape by pushing the marginal cost of publishing down to zero. Now, anyone can share their ideas, whether in books, videos, podcasts, or even in blog posts.\\n\\nChatGPT has done the same thing, but for content. By reducing the amount of effort required to turn thoughts into words on a page, this technology lowered the bar, putting a greater emphasis on ideas by making execution easier.\\n\\nWe would be limiting ourselves to thinking that generative AI is only going to help people share their insights. In the months and years to come, we’re going to see an explosion of new ideas and use cases. This is to say that the concept of generative AI, as demonstrated by ChatGPT, won’t reach its full potential until it’s turned into a product.\\n\\nContact  Moveworks to learn how AI can supercharge your workforce\\'s productivity.\\n\\nnews\\n\\nMore blog posts\\n\\nHow to unlock continual service improvement with AIOps\\n      \\n        \\n          Discover how AIOps transforms IT operations from reactive to proactive.

Large language models are a groundbreaking technology.\\n\\nLarge language models, also referred to as LLMs, are poised to revolutionize how we think about conversational AI for the enterprise and its potential applications. Tech giants like Microsoft, Meta and Google know that large language models are fast becoming essential for people to innovate, automate, and improve the lives of the end user as a whole.\\n\\nOne such example that’s taken the world by storm is ChatGPT, which uses OpenAI’s GPT (Generative Pre-Trained Transformer) to accomplish tasks in a few seconds that would normally take a human hours or days. The generative AI capabilities alone have spawned countless use cases and business opportunities for those eager to dive-in and learn.\\n\\nBut first, let’s explore large language model basics and their applications in real-world use cases. We’ll cover:\\n\\nWhat large language models are\\n\\nLarge language model examples\\n\\nLarge language model strengths and challenges\\n\\nApplications of large language models\\n\\nHow large language models will change businesses\\n\\nWhat the future of large language models looks like\\n\\nWhat are large language models?\\n\\nLarge language models (LLMs) are advanced artificial intelligence algorithms trained on massive amounts of text data for the purposes of content generation, summarization, translation, classification, sentiment analysis and so much more. How massive are these datasets? Smaller datasets are composed of tens of millions of parameters, while larger sets extend into hundreds of billions of data points. Depending on the purpose of the large language model (LLM), the training data will vary.\\n\\nExample datasets and what their purpose include:\\n\\nSocial media posts: Publicly available social posts can be used to train the model to understand informal language, slang, and online trends, as well as to identify sentiment\\n\\nAcademic papers: Scholarly articles can be used to understand terminology and technical language, as well as to extract key information\\n\\nWeb pages: Publicly available web sites can be used to understand writing styles or increase the range of topics a large language model can understand\\n\\nWikipedia: Because of the vast knowledge that Wikipedia houses, this can be used to increase the range of topics a large language model can understand\\n\\nBooks: Books of various genres can be used to understand different writing styles, storyline development, and narrative structures\\n\\nYou may be asking yourself, how does a large language model produce text in a human-like fashion? Using the above examples, if a model is trained on social media posts and books, it becomes easier for the model to produce text in a human-like fashion because it has a clear understanding of formal and informal language. So in reality, the answers it produces is highly dependent on the training data used.\\n\\nHow do large language models work?\\n\\nTo understand how large language models work, you first need to understand transformer architecture. Transformer architecture is the backbone of the transformer models like GPT and many other prominent models.\\n\\nThe transformer architecture is a neural network architecture that allows for parallel processing and is used by large language models to process data and generate contextually relevant responses. It consists of a series of layers, with each layer consisting of parallel processing components called attention mechanisms and feedforward networks. The attention mechanisms weigh the importance of each word, using statistical models to learn the relationships between words and their meanings. This allows LLMs to process sequences in parallel and generate contextually relevant responses.\\n\\nFigure 1: Large language models (LLMs) leverage vast amounts of training data to understand and respond to user prompts conversationally.\\n\\nWhat are some examples of large language models?\\n\\nThe most talked about models are by OpenAI (GPT-2, GPT-3, GPT-4, Whisper), Google (BERT, T5, PaLM), and Meta (M2M-100, LLaMA, XLM-R). These are some just examples of the most common ones but as stated before, models are trained for specific purposes so there isn’t a single model that does everything.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers): BERT is a transformer-based model that has been pre-trained on a massive amount of text data. It is designed to perform natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as sentiment analysis, question-answering, and text classification.\\n\\nGPT-3 (Generative Pretrained Transformer 3): Developed by OpenAI, GPT-3 is a large language model considered one of the most advanced AI models in the world. It has been trained on a vast amount of text data and can generate human-like responses to a wide range of topics and questions, while maintaining a wide array of conversational memory.\\n\\nXLM-R (Cross-lingual Language Model - RoBERTa): XLM-R is a transformer-based large language model developed by Facebook AI Research. It is pre-trained on a massive amount of text data in multiple languages and fine-tuned for specific NLP tasks such as text classification, machine translation, and question-answering.\\n\\nWhisper: Whisper is a large-scale automatic speech recognition (ASR) system developed by OpenAI. It is trained on 680,000 hours of diverse and multi-lingual data, resulting in improved robustness to accents, background noise, and technical language. It has the ability to transcribe speech in multiple languages and perform translation into English.\\n\\nT5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer): Developed by Google Research, T5 is a large language model designed to perform various NLP tasks such as text-to-text generation, summarization, and translation. It utilizes transfer learning to fine-tune its capabilities for specific NLP tasks, making it a highly versatile model.\\n\\nM2M-100 (Multilingual Machine Translation 100): M2M-100 is a multilingual machine translation model that can translate between any pair of 100 languages without relying on English data. The model is trained on a total of 2,200 language directions, this model is 10 times better than the previous best, English-centric multilingual models.\\n\\nMPNet (Masked and Permuted Language Modeling Pre-training Network): MPNet is a pre-training method for language models that combines masked language modeling (MLM) and permuted language modeling (PLM) in one view. It takes the dependency among the predicted tokens into consideration through permuted language modeling, advancing BERT\\'s classification methodologies.\\n\\nWhen comparing the performance and capabilities of these models, it is important to note that each model has been trained for a very specific purpose, and the best model will depend on the specific NLP task at hand. Large language models have demonstrated impressive performance in various natural language processing tasks and have the potential to greatly enhance businesses\\' efforts in customer engagement, operations, and beyond.\\n\\nWhat are large language models used for?\\n\\nLarge language models are becoming increasingly popular in various industries and businesses because they can process and understand human language at scale. These models use deep learning techniques to analyze vast amounts of text data, making them highly proficient in language processing tasks such as text generation, summarization, translation, and sentiment analysis.\\n\\nWith these capabilities, large language models have revolutionized the field of conversational AI and have a range of real-world applications.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nCustomer Service: They can be used to develop support chatbots that can engage with customers conversationally, improve customer engagement, and drive efficient operations.\\n\\nText Translation: They can also be used in language translation software to accurately translate text from one language to another, making communication and understanding between people who speak different languages much easier.\\n\\nMarketing: Models can be used to create ad copy, ad creatives, and even a communication strategy.\\n\\nCoding: They can write, optimize or help fix code.\\n\\nHealthcare: Language models can help with knowledge retrieval which can help support clinical decision making.\\n\\nAs more large language model applications are developed the companies that are able to harness their true power will be measurable improvements across their organizations.\\n\\nWhy are large language models so important for enterprises?\\n\\nLarge language models represent a transformative technology that can help enterprises access conversational AI and automate mundane tasks that their workforce incurs every day. By leveraging advanced conversational AI capabilities, these models have the potential to deliver unprecedented value to organizations, from curating a superior user experience to reducing costs.\\n\\nBy embracing large language models, enterprises can gain a strategic advantage, remain competitive in a rapidly changing market, and deliver real business value to their customers. It\\'s crucial, however, to have a comprehensive understanding of their complexities to effectively apply them in practical settings.\\n\\nAI copilot. AI copilots are one of the more recent trends where companies are using LLMs to develop chatbot-like interfaces that can support users across the enterprise. Some examples of this are\\n\\nMoveworks’ enterprise copilot,\\n\\nMicrosoft’s 365 copilot,\\n\\nGithub’s Copilot, and\\n\\nSalesforce’s Einstein.\\xa0 AI copilots will continue to come out as more and more companies build out their use cases so it’s important to have an\\n\\nAI copilot strategy when looking to incorporate them into your organization.\\n\\nWhat are large language models\\' strengths?\\n\\nLarge language models have immense potential for organizations and can bring about a paradigm shift in how they operate.\\n\\n1. Out-of-the-box advanced natural language processing capabilities\\n\\nIn the past, building a conversational AI required a significant effort from a team of experts who spent countless hours creating multiple machine learning algorithms.\\n\\nHowever, the advent of large language models, such as the GPT-3.5 model powering ChatGPT, has changed this landscape. Instead of using multiple algorithms, a single model now performs all the functions previously performed by multiple systems. This has made natural language processing more accessible, as conversing with ChatGPT is now equivalent to having a Swiss watch at your fingertips.\\n\\n2. Powerful generative capabilities\\n\\nLanguage learning models possess a powerful generative capability that makes them valuable assets for the enterprise. With their advanced conversational AI abilities, LLMs can assist businesses in exploring new ideas, developing new products and services, and improving existing ones. The generative abilities of LLMs enable the creation of written content, such as product descriptions, marketing copy, reports, and other digital assets, like images, videos, and software code.\\n\\nLLMs also can analyze and understand large amounts of data and information, allowing them to provide insightful recommendations to improve business processes and decision-making. Moreover, the conversational interface of LLMs makes it easy for teams to share and collaborate on ideas and projects, increasing productivity and streamlining the creative process.\\n\\n3. Seamless conversational user experience\\n\\nLanguage learning models offer a seamless conversational user experience that is unmatched by traditional AI systems. The enterprise can use this by integrating LLMs into customer-facing applications, such as chatbots, to improve internal communication and support. LLMs can understand user inquiries and provide personalized and efficient support, improving satisfaction.\\n\\nIn IT support, for instance, LLMs can assist with resolving tickets and problems quickly and accurately. Automating certain support tasks conversationally allows businesses to free up valuable resources and focus on more complex issues requiring human expertise.\\n\\n4. Increased user efficiency\\n\\nLLMs are equipped to comprehend and process human language, making them suitable for automating monotonous and time-consuming tasks.\\n\\nFor instance, in IT, LLMs can handle simple queries and support requests, allowing human agents to concentrate on more complicated problems. Or in the financial sector, LLMs can automate financial transactions and data processing, reducing the manual effort and resources needed.\\n\\nLLMs\\' ability to increase efficiency and lower costs is one of the many reasons they are fast becoming indispensable tools across various industries. By automating tedious tasks, LLMs allow organizations to focus on their core competencies and drive growth and innovation.\\n\\nWhat are large language models\\' challenges?\\n\\nUnderstanding large language model nuances is crucial in using them in real-world applications. There are three main large language model weaknesses to consider when thinking about how to apply them practically in business:\\n\\n1. Inconsistent accuracy\\n\\nLarge language models, including OpenAI\\'s GPT-3.5, are powerful tools that can provide accurate responses to complex questions. However, despite their impressive capabilities, there is still a risk of inaccurate or false responses, known as \"hallucination.\"\\n\\nThis phenomenon can have serious implications in critical industries like healthcare and business operations. It is essential to implement safeguards such as human oversight to refine inputs and control outputs to mitigate this risk. Currently, many applications of large language models require human supervision to ensure reliable results but one promising method that aims to fix this is grounding.\\n\\n2. Lack of enterprise context\\n\\nLarge language models have been trained on a vast amount of text data from the internet. Still, they need enterprise-specific context and domain knowledge to provide specific solutions to industry-specific problems. While they can provide general information and context on various topics, they may not have the depth of understanding and experience required to solve complex, industry-specific challenges.\\n\\nAdditionally, language models may not have access to proprietary information or be aware of the specific regulations and policies that govern a particular industry. As a result, they may only sometimes be able to provide accurate or reliable information in the context of a specific enterprise. It is essential to understand these limitations and seek expert advice when dealing with industry-specific issues.\\n\\n3. Limited controllability\\n\\nWhile language models are powerful and accessible to non-experts, they lack controllability. This means their response to a specific input cannot be easily directed or controlled. The layered approach to building LLMs saves time in training complex systems but limits the ability to control the model\\'s responses in a more demanding environment.\\n\\nTo be effective in a business setting, LLMs must be part of a larger AI architecture that offers control and fine-tuning through additional training, evaluation, and alternative machine learning approaches.\\n\\n4. Stale training data.\\n\\nLarge language models are trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and respond to natural language in a human-like manner. However, their training data is limited to a specific time period and may not reflect the current state of the world. Updating an LLM\\'s knowledge is complex and requires retraining the model, which is extremely expensive.\\n\\nInstructing the LLM to override certain parts of its knowledge while retaining others is also challenging. Even then, there\\'s no guarantee that the model won\\'t provide outdated information, even if the search engine it\\'s paired with has up-to-date information. This poses a unique challenge in a business setting where data is often private and constantly changing in real-time.\\n\\n5. Personal data risk\\n\\nLLMs are trained on vast amounts of text data, including sensitive personal information, which they may have access to while generating responses. This personal information can be leaked through the model\\'s outputs or training data.\\n\\nAdditionally, the training data used to develop LLMs may not always be properly anonymized or secured, which increases the risk of personal data breaches. The use of LLMs in industries handling sensitive personal information, such as healthcare or finance, requires careful consideration and proper security measures to prevent data leakage.\\n\\nHow exactly will large language models impact the enterprise?\\n\\nSince ChatGPT launched, it’s given everyone who’s played around with it a sense of wonderment. And what’s even more remarkable is that this is only scratching the surface of what’s possible with generative AI.

By combining Nexthink’s Digital Employee Experience Software with Moveworks’ conversational AI platform, companies can provide proactive and personalized IT support to their employees in a matter of minutes — not days.\\n\\nBy leveraging the combined power of Nexthink and Moveworks, customers can benefit from scalable IT that focuses on strategic, high-impact projects, stronger employee engagement on IT messages. Self-service backed by DEX creates the quickest path towards issue resolution by putting the choice in employees’ hands. In fact, joint customer Broadcom was able to resolve 57% of IT issues autonomously with the Moveworks chat, while also seeing a 20%-40% reduction in IT incidents using Nexthink’s real-time insight into IT environments.\\n\\n“At Broadcom, we’re focused on making sure our global workforce can stay as productive and engaged as possible, no matter where they work,” said Stanley Toh, Head of Enterprise End User Services and Experience at Broadcom. “The visibility and automated remediation that Nexthink provides, combined with Moveworks’ best-in-class AI, gives our employees greater control over their experience, and the self-healing capabilities allow our IT team to stay ahead of issues. Together, Moveworks and Nexthink are a powerful combination to ensure a digital employee experience without delays and disruptions getting in the way. We’re excited that they are partnering, and look forward to doing even more with both solutions.”\\n\\nThe complexity of today’s digital workplace causes constant disruptions for employees, who – across a workforce – can rely on hundreds of applications, storage, and hardware to get their work done. This opens up countless opportunities for technology breakdown, causing massive support bottlenecks for IT teams, and slow response times as a result. By combining the automation and insights of Nexthink with conversational AI support from Moveworks, joint customers are now eliminating these disruptions for their employees. The partnership transforms support in two ways: By instantly supplying the right solution when employees submit an issue, and by proactively preventing issues before they even ask for help.\\n\\n“Today’s employees have made their ‘offices’ in the confines of their devices, which means an IT disruption of any size can have a major impact on workflow,” said Yassine Zaied, Chief Strategy Officer at Nexthink. “Nexthink and Moveworks are both hyper-focused on creating better employee experiences, and together, we can quickly and proactively avoid or mitigate the IT issues plaguing today’s employees by empowering them with the right solution for their needs.”\\n\\nWith Moveworks and Nexthink, businesses can proactively identify issues and send out targeted messages that result in action. This process ultimately prevents issues from ever needing to be routed to the service desk, which frees up IT teams to focus on other projects. For example, Nexthink can identify when an employees’ disk space is low and recommend a solution, Moveworks’ chat function can prompt the user to take this action to resolve the issue. And, when employees inevitably run into support issues throughout their day, they can leverage Moveworks’ conversational AI, which works with Nexthink to identify the right action to then resolve. For example, an employee messages Moveworks saying they are experiencing crashes in Excel. Moveworks’ natural language understanding (NLU) can interpret symptoms and Nexthink will be leveraged to recommend an automated Office 365 repair.\\n\\n“The shift to digital work is an incredible opportunity for companies to get the employee experience right,” said Bhavin Shah CEO at Moveworks. “The key to creating a great digital workplace is fixing issues before they become bigger problems, and quickly resolving them when they do arise. We’re excited to partner with Nexthink in making this vision a reality for businesses today.”\\n\\nTo learn more about this partnership, check out\\xa0this blog.\\n\\nMedia Contact\\n\\nSophia Xepoleas, Sr PR Manager\\n\\nEmail:\\n\\npr@moveworks.ai\\n\\nWeb:\\n\\nMoveworks.com/contact\\n\\nSolutions\\n\\nCustomers\\n\\nResources\\n\\nBlog\\n\\nSitemap\\n\\nPlatform\\n\\nPlatform overview\\n\\nMoveworks API\\n\\nSystem status\\n\\nCompany\\n\\nAbout us\\n\\nNewsroom\\n\\nContact us\\n\\nCareers\\n\\n©2023 Moveworks, Inc.\\n\\nPrivacy policies', metadata={'source': 'https://www.moveworks.com/press-releases/2022/07/nexthink-and-moveworks-join-forces-to-enable-proactive-tech-support-in-the-digital-workplace/'}),\n",

And as the rapid transition to working from home floods these service desks with high-volume requests, our AI is playing an unexpected role in alleviating their workloads by resolving remote employees’ support issues, wherever they are and whenever they ask. Moveworks is committed to assisting those impacted by the current crisis, and we quickly realized there was more we could do to help.\\n\\nAfter speaking with dozens of our customers to better understand the challenges they’re facing, we’ve released dedicated capabilities to resolve IT support requests related to COVID-19, from questions about their companies’ response policies to help configuring video conferences. In this post, I’ll discuss both new and existing use cases for Moveworks that we’ve started to see streamline the switch to WFH — allowing employees to stay productive, augmenting the firepower of the IT team, and ensuring business continuity for the organization as a whole.\\n\\nAn unprecedented test for IT teams\\n\\nWe’ve spent several years partnering with IT teams across market verticals as they’ve sought to ensure their employees can work as smoothly from outside the office as they do while on-site. In their journeys toward achieving this goal, which has become more important than ever before, they’ve come to recognize that IT services, applications, and communication tools must be available not only from anywhere but also at any time, since work-from-home schedules are often erratic. Moreover, because of the recent trend toward physical, in-person help desks, many employees don’t know where to go for support when they’re out of office. Many end up simply emailing all their questions and requests to IT.\\n\\nFor all these reasons, providing rapid, 24/7 support to a remote workforce is not a realistic possibility for human agents alone, particularly given the increasing volumes of tickets. At Moveworks, for instance, we’ve already observed significant spikes among our end-users in requests for collaboration apps, in how-to questions pertaining to those apps, in VPN setup and troubleshooting queries, in orders for devices and peripherals, and in clarifications around company policy, among other tickets. We expect these trends to continue or potentially intensify as the situation develops.\\n\\nFigure 1: As employees transition to working from home, IT teams are handling a growing number of requests for software, which Moveworks can automatically provision on their behalf. For instance, requests for Zoom were up 140% from March 4-14, month-over-month.\\n\\nTo address these challenges, the Moveworks bot converses with employees in natural language straight on the messaging tool they use every day — driving them to submit their IT issues on our platform rather than over email. And even if they do send an email, Moveworks intercepts it and updates the submitter on the messaging tool. Moveworks then determines what an employee is asking for using a combination of machine learning models, before autonomously resolving the issue via deep integrations with other software. Our AI can also search your entire knowledge base to find the most relevant, snippet-sized answers to employees’ questions, such as those about COVID-19 preparedness. In fact, our internal Moveworks bot, which we call “M8,” has been indispensable during our company-wide shift to work-from-home.\\n\\nBelow are four primary components of our ongoing efforts to aid our customers in their response to COVID-19:\\n\\nBroadcast capability to spread awareness\\n\\nMoveworks’ broadcast capability was a roadmap feature that we’ve now made ready and available to customers. It enables IT leadership to send out mass communication to either the entire company or to targeted groups based on their seniority, the risk-level of their location, and so on. Whereas mass emails tend to get lost in the inbox — with only about 1% engagement — broadcast messages sent through Moveworks average a 30% engagement rate. And because Moveworks fields employees’ questions, communications sent via the bot don’t end up flooding the IT team with requests for clarification.\\n\\nFigure 2: Moveworks can disseminate broadcast announcements from the IT team on messaging tools like Slack and Microsoft Teams, and then provide those teams detailed analytics on employee engagement.\\n\\nAnswering COVID-19 questions\\n\\nsemantic search scours your company’s entire knowledge base to match employees’ questions with snippet-sized answers. Semantic search was originally optimized to answer IT questions, like how to add virtual backgrounds on Zoom meetings. But thanks to significant work from our engineering team, we can now answer COVID-19 related questions as well — and even supplement your existing knowledge base with the resources we’ve created.\\n\\nFigure 3: Our internal Moveworks bot, M8, demonstrating how semantic search\\n\\nanswers employees’\\n\\nCOVID-19 questions.\\n\\nMoveworks Channel Resolver\\n\\nAs IT tickets submitted through conventional avenues have risen, so too have messages posted in IT support chat channels on Slack, threatening to overwhelm the IT team. Moveworks’ Channel Resolver reads each message posted in these channels and jumps in when it’s confident it can help. The bot then messages the channel once the issue is resolved and keeps tabs on everything, so the IT team doesn’t have to worry about falling behind.\\n\\nFigure 4: We’ve seen a flurry of activity that looks just like this across our customers’ IT support channels on Slack. Moveworks ensures that not a single message gets lost in the shuffle.\\n\\nEmphasis on availability of core service\\n\\nWe’ve scaled up our infrastructure and increased our monitoring coverage across all our product offerings, recognizing that core Moveworks functionalities — like helping employees get instant access to software — will prove to be crucial. We’re standing by to guarantee our customers prompt assistance on any issues or questions, in addition to working with their IT leaders to implement new capabilities as needed.\\n\\nMoveworks is continuing to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely to assess what else we can do to support our customers. Above all, we hope you stay safe and healthy in the weeks ahead. While we may be physically separated from our colleagues, we must all pull together and look out for one another during this time.\\n\\nproduct features\\n\\nMore blog posts\\n\\nHow to unlock continual service improvement with AIOps\\n      \\n        \\n          Discover how AIOps transforms IT operations from reactive to proactive.

But as with any new buzz-worthy technology, it can be challenging for business leaders to separate signal from noise and think strategically about the opportunities and risks of implementing this tech.\\n\\nAt Moveworks, we know that the key to success in implementing AI in the enterprise is to choose the right partner and approach the technology strategically. I recently sat down with Forrester Analyst Will McKeon White to discuss the opportunities and risks of implementing generative and conversational AI, and to help business leaders navigate this rapidly developing landscape.\\n\\nThe truth is, the myths around chatbots and AI have been shattered. It's now clear that chatbots do work, people do like them, and AI is ready for prime time. But that doesn't mean that every application is suitable or that every vendor is a good fit.\\n\\nWhen evaluating AI vendors, it's crucial to consider factors such as their track record, their technical approach, and their ability to adopt and deploy LLMs. In a world where every application will become an AI application, it's essential to work with a vendor that can keep up with the pace of change.\\n\\nThis is to say that exciting times are ahead for innovative CIOs who are looking to invest in conversational AI. But it's crucial to approach this technology with a clear understanding of its potential benefits and risks. With the right strategy and approach, generative and conversational AI can be powerful tools for driving innovation and transforming the enterprise.\\n\\nTo gain a deeper understanding of how conversational AI can transform your business, I invite you to check out the full webinar.

Over the last few years, IT teams have embraced employee-facing chat channels as an alternative way to provide support, since there’s a good chance that someone in the group is experiencing the same issue, or has created a workaround, or even knows the solution.\\n\\nIn reality, of course, these helpful messages will be mixed in with just as many unhelpful ones, meaning that service desk agents must read through each thread to determine the best course of action. It all amounts to lots of extra work for IT teams that are already overextended.\\n\\nNow imagine the ideal team member in the IT support channel. They read every single message — day or night, weekend or holiday — and always respond when they can help. They go beyond giving advice; in many cases, they resolve the problem for you in seconds, without any effort from the IT team. Well, after extensive R&D and field testing, that ideal team member is ready for action. Introducing Moveworks’ Channel Resolver for Slack:\\n\\nFigure 1: Channel Resolver messages the employee directly, then updates the channel.\\n\\nSupercharging IT support on Slack\\n\\nMoveworks understands the challenges employees face when trying to get a support issue resolved — and how delays in resolution hinder their productivity. Our vision has always been to make it easy to solve employee issues through the use of natural language understanding and conversational AI: resolution should come instantly, no matter where those issues are reported. Channel Resolver represents a major step toward realizing that vision of frictionless IT support.\\n\\nAvailable to all Moveworks customers who use Slack, Channel Resolver is a version of our AI bot that resides in a public chat channel. It analyzes each employee question, and if our natural language understanding (NLU) and resolution platform predicts that it can remediate the issue, it jumps in. In fact, an initial group of a dozen customers — including AppDynamics — have already transformed their IT support with Channel Resolver.\\n\\nFigure 2: Using standard emojis, Channel Resolver indicates both that it’s analyzed an employee’s message (the eyes) and that the issue’s been resolved (the checkmark).\\n\\nFrom a broader perspective, IT channels complement the modern, chat-first business strategy, which integrates formerly separate workflows on the chat tool that employees use every day. There’s no longer any need to log in to specialized tools like portals, as we explained in our post, \"Anytime, anywhere, automatic.\" But resolving employees’ issues over chat also presents challenges for IT teams. How do you stay on top of so many questions and requests? And how do you respond fast enough that employees feel they\\'re being heard?\\n\\nWe recognized that natural language understanding and conversational AI could address these challenges, and we built the Channel Resolver capability to do just that.\\n\\nA new way to support employees\\n\\nAs a machine learning company, we learn a lot from data, which we augment with customer feedback from onsite usability studies, interviews, and pilot programs to bridge the gap between theory and reality. A recurring theme in our research and customer discussions was that, with company-wide IT channels exploding in popularity, keeping pace with requests in those channels was becoming impractical for IT support teams.\\n\\nOur task, then, was to build a mechanism through which we could do the following:\\n\\nUse NLU to understand messages posted in the IT channel\\n\\nResolve issues autonomously whenever feasible\\n\\nAdhere to the unique conventions and processes of in-channel support\\n\\nHand issues off to agents if necessary\\n\\nThis would all have to be done with extremely high precision because, when you make a mistake in a public channel, everybody can see it. And at the same time, we would have to maintain high coverage — the percentage of requests handled by the bot — to ensure issues wouldn’t pile up in IT agents’ queues. Needless to say, building this capability is not trivial. Below, we explore the reasons why supporting channels is even harder than supporting requests that come in via direct message (DM).\\n\\nSeparating the signal from the noise\\n\\nChannels are significantly “noisier” than DMs or emails: they contain broadcast announcements from service desk agents, non-IT-related interactions between employees, reposted questions, jokes, memes, and everything in between. All of this makes understanding in-channel messages much more difficult than those sent in a direct, employee-to-bot conversation.\\n\\nFigure 3: Separating the signal from the noise is intuitive for humans, but profoundly difficult for machines.\\n\\nThe overarching challenge here is that the structure of messages, comments, and responses is unpredictable. Our NLU system needs to be able to parse these complex utterances and provide users with the right answers when needed, an objective that requires many machine learning models to achieve.\\n\\nResolve, route, or disregard: Determining the right response\\n\\nAs we’ve seen, channels are not a good place for trigger-happy bots. Given the public nature of the channel setting, it’s critical for a bot to jump in only when it’s confident it can resolve an employee issue. The machine learning model thresholds for in-channel responses must therefore be tuned to trigger at higher confidence level than for DMs.\\n\\nSo how does Moveworks actually decide which, if any, response is appropriate for each employee question? As we’ll examine at length in an upcoming blog series, our conversational AI platform was created explicitly to address the shortcomings of historical chatbots that relied on hard-coded decision trees. In the figure below, for example, a hard-coded model focused on keywords could easily misclassify the request for Microsoft Office as a problem with Okta:\\n\\nFigure 4: A typical, noisy message in an IT support channel, filled with red herrings and irrelevant details that would confuse historical chatbots.\\n\\nBy contrast, Moveworks’ probabilistic engine weighs a number of variables — including syntax, semantics, previous IT tickets from the company, and even the employee’s department — to tackle the nuances of natural human language. Each of our resolution skills, such as our Software Access skill, then “bids” on the right to resolve an employee’s issue, with higher bids corresponding to higher levels of confidence in the model’s prediction. In this case, the Software Access skill generates the only bid that exceeds the confidence threshold, prompting the bot to autonomously provision Microsoft Office.\\n\\nFigure 5: Moveworks’ probabilistic engine uses an auction system to determine the best action.\\n\\nWhen our bot can’t fully resolve an issue, it must seamlessly hand off to the right person on the service desk. We met this goal by developing a new system of interaction that allows Channel Resolver to provide the necessary information for agents to step in and pick up where the bot left off, facilitating faster response.\\n\\nChanging the channel with AI\\n\\nFigure 6: For employees awaiting IT support, Channel Resolver turns days into seconds.\\n\\nFor the first time, employees can get instant resolution directly in the IT support channel — from software provisioning to account unlocks to installation instructions to the guest WiFi password. And for IT teams, Channel Resolver means that Ask-IT channels no longer require an army of agents to maintain. The verdict is clear: it’s time to supercharge your Slack workspace with AI.\\n\\nContact Moveworks to demo and deploy Channel Resolver on your IT support channel.\\n\\ntechnology\\n\\nMore blog posts\\n\\nHow to unlock continual service improvement with AIOps\\n      \\n        \\n          Discover how AIOps transforms IT operations from reactive to proactive.

A technical glitch — no matter how minor — can cause significant disruption. Still, many employees would rather suffer in silence than file a ticket and deal with long wait times. But when issues go unreported or are hidden from IT teams, problems quickly become more serious and more frustrating.\\n\\nThat’s why I’m excited to announce Moveworks’ new strategic partnership with Nexthink. It enables customers to create a digital workplace where IT can take action based on a comprehensive view of employees’ day-to-day experiences. In just one example, Broadcom was able to resolve 57% of IT issues autonomously with Moveworks, while also seeing a 20% to 40% reduction in IT incidents using Nexthink’s real-time insight into its IT ecosystem.\\n\\nMoveworks’ conversational AI and Nexthink’s automation and insights are a powerful combination. I’ll set out two key areas where this partnership can make an immediate impact for both IT teams and employees:\\n\\nReal-time end-to-end automation\\n\\nProactive issue prevention\\n\\nSee all of Moveworks' partners and integrations →\\n\\nSurface the right solutions in seconds\\n\\nWhen an employee has a tech problem, they feel symptoms: an email not sending or a computer that’s slow to start up. But they don’t always know how, or even if, they can resolve the issue on their own. Working through this low-grade pain every day isn’t easy, and as a result, performance and productivity suffer.\\n\\nNow with the Moveworks-Nexthink partnership, when employees inevitably run into a support issue, they can just ask their bot. Moveworks’ conversational AI can interpret the issue, no matter how many words or what kind of jargon an employee uses. Then, the bot can recommend a specific remote action from Nexthink, resolving the issue in seconds.\\n\\nFigure 1: When an employee experiences a technical issue, Moveworks can trigger an action via Nexthink to solve the problem instantly.\\n\\nFor example, an employee messages Moveworks saying she can’t send emails. Moveworks’ natural language understanding (NLU) interprets her message, and then leverages Nexthink to address Outlook Online connectivity issues. If the employee’s Excel keeps crashing, their device has low disk space, or their laptop is slow to start up, the same applies.\\n\\nThe Moveworks-Nexthink partnership gives employees the ability to help themselves, reducing stress on overburdened IT teams and allowing everyone to focus on strategic projects without interruption.\\n\\nResolve issues proactively\\n\\nMoveworks and Nexthink can prompt bigger improvements than just dealing with issues in real time. Together, we can prevent problems from happening in the first place.\\n\\nAs soon as Nexthink detects an issue, employees are automatically prompted to take action directly through their Moveworks bot. Since these notifications target the individual experiencing a specific issue, messages receive high engagement and ultimately prevent an issue from ever getting routed to the service desk.\\n\\nFigure 2:\\xa0Nexthink notifies Moveworks when a disruptive issue occurs, so our bot can reach out to the individual affected and deliver a solution.\\n\\nFor example, Nexthink can identify when an employee has recently experienced a system crash and recommend a solution in seconds. Then, Moveworks’ conversational AI takes over, prompting the user to take action — in this case, to download a new browser — to resolve the issue.\\n\\nAddressing low disk space or dealing with other periodic device maintenance now happens immediately, without any involvement from IT. By preventing issues from arriving at your service desk, your team can focus on projects that matter, not busy work.\\n\\nPut your people first with Moveworks and Nexthink\\n\\nThe combined power of Moveworks and Nexthink allows joint customers to make getting help at work effortless. Ours is the sort of partnership that’s bringing advanced and much-needed AI solutions to IT teams looking to level up their employee experience.\\n\\nBy fixing problems before they get out of hand and quickly resolving any issues that do arise, we empower businesses to exceed their employees' expectations. Together we can help IT teams continuously improve their day-to-day digital workplace experience.\\n\\nManoj Gupta is the VP of Partnerships at Moveworks.

However, this method of interacting with computers — a Graphical User Interface, or GUI — is neither efficient nor natural.\\n\\nWhen GUIs were introduced in the 1980s, they ushered in a new era when anyone, including people without programming skills, could suddenly use a computer. We should be careful not to take GUIs for granted: previously, operating a PC required memorizing complex commands to accomplish even the most simple tasks. But at a time when unfamiliar devices and SaaS applications enter our lives every week, the graphical user interface is no longer a sustainable approach, since it entails a significant learning curve to become proficient with these new tools.\\n\\nFigure 1:\\n\\nWhile commonplace, the graphical user interface requires time and training\\n\\nto complete complex tasks.\\n\\nIn short, GUIs risk being unintuitive. No matter how much engineering and design work goes into creating a “natural” interface, it’s impossible to create buttons that capture every conceivable user intention. Fundamentally, our natural form of communication isn’t buttons, but language. And as our technology becomes increasingly complex, the ability to operate that technology with simple, conversational language will pave the way for users to derive even more benefit from their applications, in much the same way that GUIs did for a previous generation.\\n\\nIn this post, we’ll dive deep into the modern history of human-computer interaction, from the rocky beginnings of early chatbots, to today’s AI-powered conversation engines.\\n\\nFigure 2: Probabilistic chatbots are the next step in the evolution of human-machine communication.\\n\\nThe false start with early chatbots\\n\\nDespite their shortcomings, it's no surprise that chatbots are growing in popularity. Yet the experience of using most chatbots is even less intuitive than the average GUI. The fundamental problem is conversation itself, which is ambiguous, contextual, and dynamic. Conventional chatbots take a deterministic approach: that is, they rely on pre-scripted conversations that can’t keep pace with the vastness and versatility of language.\\n\\nLet’s explore why these early bots failed to understand their users:\\n\\nLevel 1: Brainless Bot\\n\\nFigure 3: Deterministic chatbots with pre-scripted responses aren’t able to keep up\\n\\nwith unexpected user responses.\\n\\nThe challenge with this real-world e-commerce bot is that people prefer to interact with language, rather than with buttons. So when users predictably type “US” into the dialog box instead of clicking the American flag icon, the bot is incapable of understanding the typed reply.\\n\\nThis kind of hardcoded chatbot simply breaks down when confronted with an unexpected response. Building any chatbot requires an incredibly high amount of technical effort, but all this work is thrown out the window when a user makes one unexpected choice. Here, the bot cannot understand or properly respond, so it instead directs the user to read an FAQ document or visit a contact page. It might not be perfect, but a predictable GUI is better than wasting time on a bot that can’t communicate.\\n\\nLevel 2: One-Hit Wonder Bot\\n\\nFigure 4: Chatbots with only basic keyword matching fail to anticipate user intent and\\n\\nare forced to fall back on a static response, in this case, a suggestion to email customer service.\\n\\nNext, let’s take a look at a slightly smarter bot. These One-Hit Wonder Bots are designed to fulfill one specific use case by applying basic keyword matching. In this scenario, everything works as expected, until a follow-up question comes into play. That's when the conversation fractures.\\n\\nThis bot is not equipped to deal with shifts in topic — a critical shortcoming, since conversation is defined by changing topics. In this example, a customer at a brick-and-mortar store would expect the salesperson to immediately answer her simple question about shoe sizes. But, unable to answer, this bot has lost a potential sale, and the customer leaves empty-handed.\\n\\nThe problem is clear: anticipating all possible directions a conversation can go is impossible. Deterministic models are incapable of conducting an organic conversation, because they have been pre-programmed with strict scenarios and can’t adapt in all the ways that language can.\\n\\nLevel 3: Overeager Bot\\n\\nFigure 5: A deterministic bot based on “if-this, then-that” rules is easily confused\\n\\nwhen a user jumps in and out of the manually scripted flow.\\n\\nIn a final example, we’ll turn to the travel industry, featuring a bot that is supposed to help find and book flights. Any frequent traveler would be excited about this bot — if it worked. It applies a naive keyword and pattern matching approach and, unfortunately, is overeager to extract a city name out of user utterance: it matches a price inquiry to the city name “Price, UT.”\\n\\nCompounding this first error, it's painful for a user to point the bot in the right direction when it goes down the wrong path. See above how the bot misinterprets the user’s intention to course-correct back to the original question of the best price. Instead, the bot misconstrues this request as asking a new question about flights to Change, France. While what the user is trying to say would be obvious to any person reading this conversation, the bot continued to misunderstand, making this whole exchange an exercise in futility.\\n\\nClearly, building a conversational platform that works intuitively is a challenge. Pre-scripted answers and decision tree models open Pandora’s box — creating more frustration than function. Given a particular input, deterministic models will always produce the same output. Much in the world, particularly language, is too complex to be reduced to unbending rules.\\n\\nAdvanced conversational AI requires a probabilistic approach\\n\\nThe reality is that language is unbound and conversation is rarely, if ever, unidirectional. None of these example chatbots are equipped to keep up, because all these bots have an approach in common: they use “if-this, then-that” logic to determine next steps. Practically speaking, the workflow engineer who attempts to build a solution using this deterministic approach will struggle. Somehow, they must anticipate all possible directions that a conversation could go. Even in a very defined environment — for example, a bot that exclusively helps sell shoes — there is no way to predict what a user will do next.\\n\\nThe unpredictability of human conversation means that deterministic chatbots are destined for disappointment. In contrast, a probabilistic approach opens the door for a bot to have naturally high-level and complex conversations with real users.\\n\\nIf you learn one thing from this post, it’s that understanding users is difficult. A deterministic approach can’t keep up with how people engage with one another. In conversations, we naturally take uncertainty into account, but for most of their history, computers haven’t been able to overcome this ambiguity. On the other hand, when powered by a probabilistic approach, chatbots can adapt to changeability.\\n\\nFigure 6: The two core components of a conversational AI system are natural language understanding\\n\\nand conversation flow management.\\n\\nSo what does it mean to have a real conversational bot? At its core, there are two components that work in tandem: natural language understanding (NLU) and conversational flow management (CFM). NLU works on understanding what the user wants, while CFM determines next steps. Conventional chatbots struggle with both of these pieces. In fact, most are limited to very basic NLU, while almost none make any attempt at intelligent conversation flow.\\n\\nIt might not be that difficult to hardcode a few user utterances and build some fixed dialogue flows as a response. But, without incorporating a probabilistic approach to both your natural language understanding and conversation flow management, a chatbot is unable to naturally navigate a real conversation that involves taking next steps, addressing follow-up questions, and managing changes in conversational direction.\\n\\nAt Moveworks, we’ve built our company on the idea that communication between people and machines should be seamless. We’ve spent years solving this problem in the domain of IT support, and what we've learned applies across the board.

It underscores the importance of AI in providing support to employees, no matter where they’re working or when they ask for help.\\n\\nIt took five years, hundreds of people, and thousands of hours to reach this milestone in our journey. Today, I want to focus on two remarkable groups of people who've fueled our success to this point: our employees and our customers.\\n\\nAt Moveworks, we understand that AI is critical to the future of work. And today’s investment enables us to take some massive leaps forward in fully realizing our vision of helping employees focus on the most meaningful projects, not busywork.\\n\\nRead the full announcement.\\n\\nEmployees who share a vision\\n\\nTo build an enduring company, you need to hire great talent. But talent alone is not enough.\\n\\nWhen your employees are in lock-step with the company vision—driven by a desire to bring it to fruition—magical things can happen. These are the employees who push the boundaries of what’s possible, who question everything in pursuit of the best path forward. Moveworks is full to the brim of employees who are wired this way.\\n\\nAs a company that develops bleeding-edge AI, we have code in production today that wasn’t possible to write just a few months ago. It wasn’t just harder, it was impossible. This is the beauty of AI. Your engineers have to constantly innovate because new machine learning models emerge every day that have the potential to make a meaningful difference to your customers—if your team can figure out how to operationalize them. It takes a special type of engineer to work in this environment.\\n\\nBut this isn’t just our approach to engineering. This is part of our culture. It’s how we move the needle across engineering, product, operations, sales, marketing… the whole company. Our team of talented, curious, and passionate people, armed with a clear vision, and empowered to make great decisions, is what makes Moveworks special.\\n\\nI’m incredibly proud of every employee at Moveworks, not just for the output of their work but also for their relentless desire to challenge the status quo.\\n\\nInterested in joining Moveworks? Apply for one of our open positions.\\n\\nCustomers that put their people first\\n\\nToday, the idea of using AI to create a better support experience for employees—whether they're remote or on-site—seems obvious. But when we founded Moveworks, few people believed it was possible, and even fewer were committed to making AI support a reality.\\n\\nOur goal was to find these few companies, and leaders, who did believe. We discovered some organizations and people that could move quickly when they saw a good idea, that were motivated to help their employees focus on the work that matters, and that were willing to make a bet.\\n\\nThese early customers were far from typical. They were, and still are, pioneers in their own right. They had the foresight to see the impact on their business that our technology could make. And it didn’t matter to them that it wasn’t perfect. They wanted to help us make it perfect. It’s these customers that enabled us to refine our vision, ideate new capabilities, and grow this company.\\n\\nThe investment and support of our early customers mean that today, you don’t have to be a pioneer to use Moveworks. They helped us build a solution every company in the world could use to get impact on day one. They enabled us to make AI accessible to everyone. It’s thanks to our customers that we get to make our vision a reality.\\n\\nCheck out our customer stories here.\\n\\nWhat's next\\n\\n2021 has been a crazy, incredible year, and there’s still a long way to go. We’re only just getting started. Despite everything we’ve already accomplished, we have so much more to do, and this investment is a huge step in helping us reach new heights.\\n\\nWe’re excited to work with our new investors, Tiger Global and Alkeon Capital, and we’re thankful to our existing investment partners, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Bain Capital, Kleiner Perkins, ICONIQ Growth, and Sapphire Ventures for increasing their investment in Moveworks during this latest round.\\n\\nThank you to everyone who has contributed to the journey so far.

Forrester recognizes Moveworks as among the top vendors who “lead the pack” in providing automated support to our enterprise customers.\\n\\nWhat we believe sets Moveworks apart is our unique approach to IT support. Rather than simply tracking IT issues or providing recommendations, Moveworks resolves those issues end-to-end — completely autonomously — by integrating with other enterprise software.\\n\\nForrester evaluated a number of specific criteria, which are graded on a scale from “needs improvement” to “on par” to “differentiated.” Moveworks received differentiated scores in five such criteria: chatbot readiness, architecture and integrations, optimization and analytics, vision, and market approach.\\n\\nHere’s what Forrester’s findings mean for our customers:\\n\\nRapid time-to-value\\n\\nFor companies looking to automate IT support with a chatbot, the first consideration is time-to-value: how long it takes to get results. Conventional “chatbot toolboxes” require IT teams to manually build scripts and dialog flows over the course of several months — then continue to adjust those workflows as the IT environment evolves. This manual approach to building a chatbot simply cannot scale.\\n\\nSo what does it mean to be differentiated when it comes to chatbot readiness? By leveraging a combination of advanced conversational AI and natural language understanding (NLU), Moveworks starts resolving IT issues on day one, without any training or scripting for the customer. The Forrester report states that “Moveworks provides significant pre-built assets, such as language and workflow,” which allow IT teams to dramatically accelerate the bot’s deployment and impact.\\n\\nConnecting the entire IT ecosystem\\n\\nThe purpose of an IT chatbot is to provide a single interface for employees to resolve all support issues, from requesting software to resetting passwords to finding the right knowledge article. With this goal in mind, Moveworks has created deep integrations with dozens of enterprise systems — and we’re excited that Forrester gave us a differentiated score in the criterion of architecture and integrations. Our platform takes autonomous action within these systems, allowing employees to self-service their IT issues directly through the bot.\\n\\nOf course, for a chatbot to effectively resolve employees’ support issues, the IT team needs visibility over which issues the bot doesn’t currently address. That’s why we’re proud to have also earned a differentiated score in the optimization and analytics criterion. Our performance insights dashboards provide almost 100 charts and metrics that track our chatbot’s impact in real time, allowing IT teams to rapidly identify and fill gaps in their bot’s existing coverage.\\n\\n“Moveworks is this simple, magical UI that talks to users and gets them answers right away, and connects to the complex backend systems that users don’t need to experience.”\\n\\nValidating our vision\\n\\nWhen we founded Moveworks in 2016, we shared a single vision: empower employees around the world to focus on impactful work. We’ve spent the last four years building an AI chatbot that resolves employees’ tech issues — instantly and autonomously — to make that vision a reality.\\n\\nSo while the Forrester report rated Moveworks as differentiated with respect to several important criteria, we’re most excited about the differentiated score we received in the vision criterion. Our chatbot has already transformed the IT support process for customers like Slack, Autodesk, and Hearst. But despite what we’ve accomplished, and despite this recognition from Forrester, we know the best is yet to come.\\n\\nDownload the Forrester New Wave™: Chatbots for IT Operations, Q4 2020 here.\\n\\nContact  Moveworks to learn how AI can supercharge your workforce productivity.\\n\\nnews\\n\\nMore blog posts\\n\\nHow to unlock continual service improvement with AIOps\\n      \\n        \\n          Discover how AIOps transforms IT operations from reactive to proactive.

It represents the largest investment ever made in an AI platform for employee service, reaffirming the company\\'s leadership in the fast-growing industry. Moveworks has now raised $315 million in total funding, with a valuation of $2.1 billion.\\n\\nLeading the round were Tiger Global and Alkeon Capital, with participation from existing investors Lightspeed Venture Partners, Sapphire Ventures, Bain Capital, ICONIQ Growth, and Kleiner Perkins. In addition, Nikesh Arora, Chairman and CEO of Palo Alto Networks and Former Chief Business Officer of Google, will be joining the board as independent director.\\n\\n\"In this new era of hybrid work, Moveworks\\' AI support offering has never been more relevant,\" said John Curtius, Partner at Tiger Global. \"Based on our research, we expect the Global 2000 to embrace AI across support use cases going forward.\"\\n\\nMoveworks is the first AI platform purpose-built to solve employees\\' support issues, from IT tickets to HR requests to policy questions. With the conventional approach, support teams take an average of three days to address these issues by hand, causing disruptions that delay important work. However, by pioneering new techniques\\xa0in natural language understanding (NLU), conversational AI, and semantic search, Moveworks has automated the entire process end-to-end. Employees simply describe what they need to Moveworks on their favorite enterprise messaging tool — such as Microsoft Teams and Slack — to get help in seconds.\\n\\nOver the past 15 months, Moveworks has seen a 700\\xa0percent\\xa0increase in active users and a 500 percent\\xa0increase in issues solved, as remote employees relied on the platform to stay productive. Moveworks allowed them to order hardware for the home office, keep pace with changing policies, troubleshoot remote collaboration tools, clarify healthcare benefits, and much more, all without having to leave Teams or Slack.\\n\\n\"AI has become a necessity to support employees in the work-from-anywhere world,\" said Moveworks CEO Bhavin Shah. \"People expect to get the help they need right away — no matter where they are, no matter when they ask. But to create such a simple experience, we had to engineer advanced deep learning techniques that didn\\'t exist before, and then make that complexity completely invisible to our users. With this investment, Moveworks will bring AI support to every employee at every enterprise.\"\\n\\nThe latest financing round follows a period of major product releases, partnerships, and recognition for Moveworks. In March, the company announced the most significant expansion in the history of its platform, which now solves support issues across all lines of business. Moveworks also\\xa0partnered with Microsoft\\xa0to create an even more seamless experience for employees: delivering help directly on Microsoft Teams. Then, in April, the company was named to the Forbes AI 50\\xa0list for the third consecutive year, before being honored as the\\xa0Best Chatbot Solution\\xa0at the 2021 AI Breakthrough Awards.\\n\\nBest Workplaces of 2021\\xa0and the\\n\\nBest Places to Work in the Bay Area, Moveworks is hiring for every department.

In 2022, companies depend on thousands of applications, systems, and devices, creating a complex experience for employees. The Moveworks API simplifies that experience by surfacing important issues on a single interface — through workflows that message impacted teams before the issues impact productivity.\\n\\nWhether employees need IT support, HR service, or a map of the new office, Moveworks uses conversational AI to resolve their requests end-to-end, without any manual intervention from support teams. Now, developers can easily build atop the Moveworks platform to address use cases unique to their business. The API means it requires only a few lines of code — and zero knowledge of AI — to reclaim unused software licenses, run targeted surveys, send system outage alerts, and manage change at scale.\\n\\n\"Moveworks\\' new API is a game-changer,\" said Stanley Toh, Head of End-User Services & Experience at Broadcom. \"Disruptive issues like the \\'blue screen of death\\' have become a non-issue for us, practically overnight. That\\'s hours and hours of productivity and frustration prevented before they happen.\"\\n\\nThe API extends the Moveworks platform to address the needs of any unique business, beyond the millions of requests it already solves out of the box. Customers will continue to realize transformational value from Moveworks, whether or not they leverage the API, because its Intelligence Engine™ comes pre-trained to understand the full diversity of workplace questions and requests.\\n\\n\"With Moveworks, our employees get information and support on time and at all hours,\" said Wendy M. Pfeiffer, CIO and SVP at\\xa0Nutanix. \"The new API is extraordinary, as it enables us to accelerate our service delivery and helps our employees to further leverage the Moveworks platform.\"\\n\\nAbout Moveworks\\n\\nMoveworks is revolutionizing how companies support their employees — with the first AI platform that makes getting help at work effortless.

And while access to a global talent pool has many benefits, it can be a real challenge for the teams tasked with supporting a global — and multilingual — workforce.\\n\\nThe most common approach to this challenge? Hiring professionals who specialize in various languages. But as companies strive to do more with less in today’s economy, hiring and managing an expensive army of agents is far from an attractive proposition.\\n\\nAnother option is to deploy a conventional support chatbot. Again, this is not a cost-efficient solution. Your team has to identify every single way an employee could ask for help, train — and re-train — a generalized translation model, manually script out dozens of conversations, and then translate every resource in your knowledge base. All of that work draws on IT’s already limited resources.\\n\\nIn short, the usual multilingual support methods are not scalable.\\n\\nWe decided to find a new way — and I’m proud to say our investment paid off: Moveworks is now capable of supporting employees in over one hundred languages.\\n\\nHow, you ask? Well, we understand that engaging people in their preferred language is deceptively difficult. It’s not just translation. Today, I’m going to dig into the details, explaining the four common technical problems that trip up conventional chatbots and how we’ve tackled them.\\n\\nProblem: Typical language models don’t account for domain- or culture-specific language.\\n\\nThe same word has different connotations based on context. And the standard translation tools that traditional chatbots use are not equipped to handle these nuances.\\n\\nCommon language models are trained using domain-agnostic data like e-news, articles, books, and other information scraped on the web. A consequence of using off-the-shelf models is that the bot will not know when to move towards enterprise term translations versus everyday terms and vice versa. The result is a failed employee interaction.\\n\\nFor example, if you type casque into a standard translation tool, it will state that casque means helmet. However, if a person refers to casque in an IT context, they would actually be referencing a headset. You can see where translations can get tricky.\\n\\nSolution: Models trained on enterprise support language, supported by annotation\\n\\nMoveworks’ language models are trained using a proprietary enterprise support data set, from 400 million examples from utterances and support tickets. That information is further enriched by 20 billion lines of open-domain data from support websites like Stack Overflow and Microsoft.\\n\\nAnother key component of accurate language models is an annotation team that can further disambiguate when a word has multiple meanings. Moveworks employs a team of linguists trained on domain-specific terms and tasks for different languages.\\n\\nData annotation ensures high-quality training data and, consequently, the accuracy of our machine learning models. In the case of multilingual enterprise support, data annotation is vital: there are simply too many nuances and variances to be captured just by machine learning algorithms. Before deploying a new model, our team confirms or changes language determination, domain annotation, and intent-entity predictions. The result is a market-best, optimized language model.\\n\\nFigure 1:“Necesito un nuevo equipo para mi equipo” means “I need a new computer for my team.” Google incorrectly translates the statement since it’s not trained on enterprise data. This is just one example of how generalized language models can be wrong.\\n\\nProblem: There is no limit to the ways employees ask for help.\\n\\nExisting chatbots are deterministic, relying heavily on rigid dialogue flows that provide pre-determined “conversational” paths the user can go down.\\n\\nScripting out and maintaining independent decision trees in one language is hard enough. in fact, we've found that there are around 500,000 different use cases in practice today across our customer base.\\n\\nNow imagine doing so for just one more language. That's hours wasted on anticipating phrases and keywords that follow unique semantic rules. That's hundreds of thousands of dollars wasted on finding someone who can build a comprehensive, native understanding of multiple langauges.\\n\\nAt best, managing multilingual dialogue flows is not scalable. At worst, it’s impossible.\\n\\n“Moveworks’ natural language understanding provides profound insight into what’s holding our people back. When we know exactly which teams and regions are feeling the most pain, we can focus our efforts and get those employees back on their feet.”\\n\\nAlok Singh, Director of IT Automation and Collaboration, Albemarle\\n\\nSolution: Language Core, an ensemble of NLU models working in unison\\n\\nMoveworks understands millions of possible utterance permutations, regardless of language. Every utterance goes through more than ten models that correct spelling, attribute parts of speech, identify entities, and more to understand a sentence without any hardwiring. At Moveworks, we call this process Language Core™, one part of our Moveworks Intelligence Engine™. Moreover, we aggregate data across all customers to dramatically increase prediction accuracy.\\n\\nBefore going through the Language Core™, the bot conducts on-the-fly translations to English using an open-source language model that’s fine-tuned through our proprietary enterprise data set. When the bot dynamically decides on the best response, we translate it back into the language of the utterance for the employee. Our approach ensures we can add languages quickly and that all languages benefit from all technical advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence.\\n\\nFigure 2: How Moveworks translates non-English user utterances.\\n\\nProblem: Knowing what to translate — and what to not translate\\n\\nWhen do you translate words, and when do you not? In an enterprise setting, there may be terms that are only used in the primary language.\\n\\nLet’s look at a simple example. A Spanish speaker may ask for access as so: “Necesito agregar Ahmed a la lista de distribución de Sales.” Here, an employee is asking in Spanish to add a person to a specific group that is in English, “Sales”. If a bot can’t handle the translation of two languages simultaneously, the bot’s response will be unsatisfactory, or flat-out wrong.\\n\\nSolution: Preemptively tagging entities with multilingual named entity recognition\\n\\nMoveworks' models leverage multilingual named entity recognition. We preemptively tag entities — the modifier the customer uses to describe their issue — and preserve them during the transformation process. Our bot is then able to use the original English entity to ensure accurate results.\\n\\nFigure 3: Here is an example of Moveworks' multilingual support named entity recognition. “Roman” and “Trello” are identified as entities and are not translated.\\n\\nProblem: Translating resources and communications for the user\\n\\nWhen using traditional chatbots, businesses must pre-emptively translate resources in their backend systems and portals. Not only must businesses aggregate the right body of resources to be translated, they must also run each resource through a language model (or outsource to 3rd party translation teams) and then create and manage a governance structure for review. Every time a knowledge base article changes, internal teams must go to each translated version and update: it’s a daunting task.\\n\\nSolution: On-the-fly translation of knowledge, comms, and more\\n\\nMoveworks leverages our multilingual support models to translate relevant snippets of knowledge base articles on-the-fly, so you do not need to create a dozen different translated iterations.\\n\\nWe also automatically translate non-English tickets from emails or self-service portals for English-speaking service desks. An employee can draft tickets in their native language and choose to send a translation, Moveworks will create a ticket in English using machine translation, and the agent’s response will be fully translated back into the user’s preferred language. In short, Moveworks supports bi-directional translated communications.\\n\\nAdditionally, Moveworks enables multilingual campaign communications. An internal service desk can send a mass email, and Moveworks will automatically translate it to the user’s preferred language. If the language detected in the comms message equals the user’s preferred language, no action will be taken.\\n\\nThe speed of our translations is powered by our expertly designed machine learning infrastructure, which minimizes the memory footprint of computations while minimizing latency. Moreover, translation quality is not compromised, no matter the message’s length. This is all done without any lift or additional resources from you.\\n\\nMy team and I understand the pain of trying to support a multilingual workforce. Going into this project, we knew it wasn’t going to be easy to build a solution that enables users across the globe to use their language of choice.\\n\\nBut that’s exactly why we’ve invested so much time and energy in our multilingual platform. We want to positively impact businesses across the world by making it easier for them to support their employees in any language..\\n\\nTo do that — we had to deeply understand where typical chat-based solutions break down. We had to find a way to manage the huge logistical challenges waiting behind a seemingly simple conversational interface. And we had to build technology that goes far beyond the limitations of earlier conversational platforms. Now, we’ve made it possible to deliver near-native employee service in more than one hundred languages.\\n\\nWith Moveworks, a company like Albemarle based in the US, but with operations in Asia, South America, and Oceania, can meet employees on their terms, in a cost-effective way that doesn’t also discount experience.\\n\\nThere is rarely a silver bullet. A lot of work has gone into our multilingual platform. I’m proud of what we accomplished here, and I’m excited to continue striving toward a world where no employee is held back from focusing on the work that matters.\\n\\nReach out to schedule a demo and see how\\xa0you\\xa0can scale support to 100+ languages.\\n\\nchatbot\\n\\nit-support\\n\\nconversational\\n\\ntechnology\\n\\nMore blog posts\\n\\nHow to unlock continual service improvement with AIOps\\n      \\n        \\n          Discover how AIOps transforms IT operations from reactive to proactive.

Here’s the problem: your comms are getting ignored.\\n\\nMost of us are experts at one-on-one conversation. When we share a significant update with a coworker at the office, we make sure we have their attention, we explain how the news impacts them personally, and we answer their inevitable follow-up questions. Yet this common sense evaporates when we need to share that same update with thousands of coworkers simultaneously, which is the central challenge of employee comms.\\n\\nToday, companies use a range of strategies to communicate with their employees en masse, from posting digital signs in the office to sending out no-reply emails. Yet these conventional strategies are noisy, impersonal, and fundamentally not interactive — the exact opposite of what makes one-on-one conversations work well. It’s no surprise that companies get only about 10% engagement with their employee comms, leaving the other 90% of the workforce vulnerable to problems that could’ve been avoided.\\n\\nSo the question is, how can we communicate with thousands of employees as effectively as we do one-on-one? We’ve worked with a select group of companies that are rethinking their approach to employee comms, including Robert Half, Autodesk, and Vituity. By combining enterprise collaboration tools like Slack and Microsoft Teams with artificial intelligence, they’ve achieved 50%–70% engagement with their messages, putting conventional mass communication methods to shame.\\n\\nIn this article, I’ll walk through the three strategies they used to fix their employee comms:\\n\\nMoving employee comms to the enterprise messaging tool\\n\\nDelivering individualized messages to only relevant recipients\\n\\nLeveraging AI to address employees’ follow-up questions and requests\\n\\nOne-way messages\\xa0→ two-way conversations\\n\\nWhile companies increasingly recognize the importance of keeping everyone on the same page, just 37% of employees say their leaders keep them informed — and that number keeps getting lower. Ultimately, driving alignment across a scattered workforce requires a new approach altogether: engaging employees directly on collaboration tools like Microsoft Teams and Slack.\\n\\nFor the team at Robert Half, the sudden shift to work-from-home threw this engagement challenge into sharp relief during the early days of the pandemic. The IT team needed to transition the company to a fully digital workplace as quickly as possible. And for them, that meant getting everyone on Microsoft Teams. Just four months into their Teams promotion campaign, they saw a roughly 6X increase in adoption companywide. How did they do it? Simple — they made all roads lead to Teams.\\n\\nBy itself, the collaboration tool is not a magic bullet — employees can ignore chat messages too. Yet, these platforms offer two major advantages. For one, collaboration tools are reserved for colleagues and business partners, leading employees to prioritize reading messages over emails. And for another, Teams and Slack are built to mimic the interactivity of real conversations in a way that isn’t possible with in-office digital signs or portal banners. Chat platforms allow employees to ask follow-up questions, send links, and share files — all essential elements of effective comms.\\n\\nRead about how Robert Half built a virtual workplace with AI →\\n\\nMass broadcasts → individual updates\\n\\nSimply moving to an enterprise chat platform — while a step in the right direction — is not an immediate cure-all. Working with Autodesk, we saw that one of the biggest keys to increasing engagement is sending highly personalized messages. By targeting different team members, with different information, at different times, they’ve seen up to 70% response rate from their employees.\\n\\nEngagement numbers are rarely so high. Conventional comms are more like putting a poster on a wall. Even if the right people are nearby, there’s no guarantee that they’re paying attention. We subconsciously tune out information that we think is irrelevant. Employees scroll past generic digital banners just like they walk by posters. And it’s the same problem when it comes to emails. Send an email at an inconvenient time, and it will fall below the fold, never to be seen again. Important messages become just more spam.\\n\\nBut by engaging employees at precisely the right moment with relevant information — that’s hard to ignore.\\n\\nThe challenge for comms teams is that manually tailoring messages to individual employees isn’t easy. It requires a high level of awareness and a complete, up-to-date understanding of everyone in the company: names, titles, roles, locations, security permissions — everything. To be successful, they need an up-to-date, 360-degree view of what’s going on to send messages that take into account time zones and have customized greetings. With this approach, employees who usually overlook mass emails learn to pay attention.\\n\\nFind out how Autodesk used AI to transform their employee experience →\\n\\nDead ends → next steps\\n\\nSending internal comms to the right place and the right people is only half the employee engagement puzzle. The other half is building an experience where next steps are obvious and everyone can ask follow-up questions.\\n\\nWe’ve all opened our inbox, seen a complicated list of steps to, say, sign up for benefits, and said to ourselves, “maybe later.” The thing is that more often than not, “maybe later” means “never.” And that’s a huge problem. On top of this information overload, once an email is sent or a banner is posted, there’s very little control over whether or not people fill out the right form or submit an expense report. Just knowing how to ask a follow-up question or what to do next is rarely, if ever, clear.\\n\\nBut with a chatbot, every message starts a conversation instead of ending it. Employees are free to ask any question at their convenience. And since every message is sent through this single bot, comms leaders finally have visibility into who has completed the relevant task and who hasn’t. Armed with that information, they can send reminders or reply to specific questions in real-time.\\n\\nInspired by the results of our customers, we worked to apply their best practices in our own environment, with our own Moveworks bot: M8. Whenever we send a message with M8, from reminders to complete the cybersecurity training to recruiting updates to changes to the 401k policy, employees can easily ask even complex questions like, “I’m moving to Boston, do these policy updates still apply?” and get an answer in seconds.\\n\\nFigure 1: Inspired by the success of our customers, we use employee comms at Moveworks to ensure that everyone is on the same page.\\n\\nCommunicate as clearly online as in person\\n\\nWhether your company is in-person, hybrid, remote, or just geographically dispersed — intentional communication is essential. With fewer in-person touchpoints, organizations need to over-deliver or fall behind.\\n\\nAt Moveworks, we've thought intently about the challenge of employee comms. We built our platform to make communications how they should be — straightforward. Because we know and you know that real communication flows both ways, but traditional internal comms flow in only one direction.\\n\\nTo replicate this most successful model of communication — talking to people — and help companies communicate as clearly online as in person, we make sure that every message you send with Moveworks is accessible, customized, and actionable. So you can make change happen when you want it to happen.\\n\\nRead more about Vituity’s employee comms strategy →\\n\\nRequest a demo to see the Moveworks platform in action.\\n\\nMore blog posts\\n\\nHow to unlock continual service improvement with AIOps\\n      \\n        \\n          Discover how AIOps transforms IT operations from reactive to proactive.

The financial services industry has always fascinated me, not just because it’s the lifeblood of an economy, but because from an operational standpoint, it sees an increasing level of complexity and innovation.\\n\\nI’ve spoken to CIOs and IT leaders at commercial banks, lenders, investment banks and insurance firms. What’s clear is that in building customer service functions of these companies, handling the fast pace of hiring new employees while maintaining a secure and compliant environment often puts IT managers in a bind.\\n\\nMark Tonnesen is a respected CIO and leads all IT at Achieve. It’s been great working with him and his awesome team such as Marty Colby and Nick Mendez as the company has grown to become one of North America’s leading financial services providers, helping US retail customers negotiate more than $10 billion in total consumer debt.\\n\\nAchieve is growing fast, so onboarding new hires is a top area of focus of the IT organization there. For Mark and Achieve, getting onboarding right is doubly important because their employees need to handle financial transactions in a secure desktop environment, and that’s a totally new working environment for most. Many new hires arrive expecting the user-friendly interfaces they've come to expect from today's mobile apps. For workers like this, pointing them to a complicated IT portal can stop them dead in their tracks: You want me to file what type of ticket? Where was that IT form again? Having great IT support systems directly impacts positive customer experience. Imagine being on the phone with a customer service agent when talking about a financial transaction and being put on hold because the agent is having an issue with their computer… a fire drill of behavior happening in the background to reach someone in IT support.\\n\\nLuckily, the era of conversational interfaces has arrived, available in enterprise messaging and powered by companies like Moveworks. We got to explore the impact AI can have on great IT support and customer impact in our latest Moveworks case study. You’ll get to see how the IT team at Achieve\\xa0rolled out Alfred, a Moveworks powered chatbot in Slack that employees — like the customer service team — just message when they need help.\\n\\nEmployees simply describe their request in a Slack message to the Alfred bot, and Moveworks uses advanced natural language understanding (NLU) and conversational AI to understand the issue and deliver a resolution. Some of Alfred’s key capabilities that are winning over employees include instant password resets, adding people to mailing lists (DLs), getting access to software, getting answers to common questions, looking up coworkers’ contact details, and filing IT tickets directly from a Slack message.\\n\\nTo find out more, download the case study.\\n\\ncustomer\\n\\nonboarding\\n\\nSlack\\n\\ncustomer stories\\n\\nMore blog posts\\n\\nHow to unlock continual service improvement with AIOps\\n      \\n        \\n          Discover how AIOps transforms IT operations from reactive to proactive.

Today, we’re a team of over 200 people from around the world, who’ve created an AI chatbot more sophisticated than anyone thought was possible, and who now support many of the most innovative companies on the planet. Between machine learning engineers, customer success managers, and graphic designers, our skills couldn’t be more different.\\n\\nBut all of us joined Moveworks because we share the same belief. We believe that AI can automate our busy work, eliminate our disruptions, and let us focus on what matters. That belief has inspired us to resolve IT issues — like unlocking accounts, finding forms, and editing email groups — in seconds, using conversational AI to give employees exactly what they need. However, despite the massive impact we’ve achieved with customers like DocuSign, Broadcom, and Hearst, we knew we could do even more than tech support.\\n\\nUltimately, we wanted to solve every issue, for every employee, across every line of business. We wanted to provide a single solution—powered by AI—that makes help automatic, from IT and HR to Finance and Facilities. One bot for every request.\\n\\nSo we built it. Introducing the Moveworks platform.\\n\\nThe serious challenge of supporting employees\\n\\nSupporting employees is one of the oldest and hardest challenges in the business world. It describes all the different ways that companies help their employees stay productive — including IT support, HR answers, policy information, and everything else that holds up important work.\\n\\nAt most companies, talented professionals are stuck solving employee support issues by hand. When an employee needs a Zoom license, or can’t remember the updated travel guidelines, she asks a person for assistance. It’s worth noting that employees could, in theory, address many of their own issues with resources that already exist, such as knowledge articles and forms. The problem? These resources are deeply buried within dozens of backend systems.\\n\\nFigure 1: Today’s complex digital businesses prevent employees from finding the resources they need.\\n\\nThe status quo of employee support has three major drawbacks:\\n\\nIt forces employees to wait days before a busy support team fulfills their request, no matter how disruptive the issue.\\n\\nIt means that highly trained professionals in IT, HR, Finance, and other departments spend the day on routine tasks, rather than rewarding projects.\\n\\nIt slows down the organization as a whole, which reduces productivity, lowers morale, and threatens to damage relationships with clients.\\n\\nThat's why we built our platform: To be a one-stop shop\\n\\nThat’s why we built the the Moveworks platform: to be a one-stop shop for instant help at work. Instead of filing an IT ticket or emailing the HR team, employees can simply describe any issue to the Moveworks bot, just as they would to a professional. Under the hood, we use breakthroughs in machine learning — more on this point in a minute — to determine and then deliver the right resource to resolve the request. Whether the solution is an FAQ, a form, a software license, a phone number, a report, or an office floor plan, Moveworks understands the issue and takes immediate action.\\n\\nFigure 2: The Moveworks platform uses advanced machine learning to understand and resolve employees’ requests.\\n\\nfinds personalized answers from within disparate knowledge bases, and\\n\\nBut for now, let me share how the Moveworks platform lets your department give employees immediate support, minus the busy work for you:\\n\\nTech support. But in seconds.\\n\\nMoveworks remains the best at solving IT support issues — instantly and automatically. By addressing more than 40% of these tech issues without any manual intervention, Moveworks empowers your service desk to prioritize higher-value work, while buying back a huge amount of time for employees.\\n\\nKey use cases:\\n\\nSoftware provisioning\\n\\nPassword resets\\n\\nEmail group updates\\n\\nIT troubleshooting\\n\\nOrdering hardware\\n\\nTransform your IT support >\\n\\nDeliver HR help. Automatically.\\n\\nIn a business climate defined by constant change, HR teams face an endless barrage of questions from employees. After analyzing millions of real-world HR questions, Moveworks can now resolve employees’ inquiries in real time — by extracting the exact paragraph with the answer from your knowledge base. Our bot is already enabling people-centric HR teams to concentrate on truly meaningful conversations.\\n\\nKey use cases:\\n\\nBenefits inquiries\\n\\nPayroll information\\n\\nTax questions\\n\\nNew hire onboarding\\n\\nEmployment verification\\n\\nAutomate your HR help >\\n\\nStop answering finance questions.\\n\\nThe Moveworks platform can now answer finance questions on your behalf — letting your team effortlessly ensure compliance with new policies. By considering each employee’s role, location, and seniority, our bot provides personalized responses to common inquiries, while routing complex requests to the right subject-matter expert.\\n\\nKey use cases:\\n\\nExpense policy questions\\n\\nCompensation inquiries\\n\\nM&A issues\\n\\nNon-disclosure agreements\\n\\nDeal process clarification\\n\\nSolve finance issues faster >\\n\\nFix facilities issues with AI.\\n\\nAs a facilities manager, you’re focused on the big picture: managing the return to work, renovating the office, and maintaining business continuity. The Moveworks platform can handle the small details for you — solving employees’ facilities issues the moment they need help. Moveworks transforms resources like FAQs and floor plans into a format optimized for chat, so that employees get their answer without leaving the conversation with our bot.\\n\\nKey use cases:\\n\\nBuilding access requests\\n\\nConference room lookups\\n\\nReturn-to-work communications\\n\\nWork-from-home coordination\\n\\nContact information\\n\\nAnswer facilities questions with AI >\\n\\nMessages that inspire action.\\n\\nAs part of the expanded platform, we’re also excited to announce our brand new module for Employee Communications, which allows company leaders to send targeted and interactive messages directly through Moveworks. And because these messages are delivered by our bot, they come with the full power of the Moveworks platform. That means employees can get answers to any follow-up questions regarding the message, right away, simply by asking Moveworks.\\n\\nKey use cases:\\n\\nSoftware migrations\\n\\nOpen enrollment\\n\\nMandatory training\\n\\nLicense reclamation\\n\\nSystem outages\\n\\nBoost engagement with your comms >\\n\\nRequest a demo to see the Moveworks platform in action.\\n\\nproduct features\\n\\nWant to learn more?\\n\\nWorking at Moveworks means working alongside a team of winners - making an impact, every day.

For any employee, the first days at a new company set the stage for what’s to come. New hires immediately pick up on how current employees use their time, what’s causing frustration, and whether or not everyone has the resources they need to do their job.\\n\\nEmployees who have a positive experience tend to stick around, but those who don’t make a quick exit. 1 in 10 employees has left a company because of poor onboarding. And a bad first impression can have significant financial consequences. Companies can lose tens of thousands of dollars in replacement and productivity costs for every employee who chooses to move on.\\n\\nAt Moveworks, we know that employees need the most support during the first moments at a new company. That’s why, when it comes to onboarding, we have a mandate:\\n\\nGive every employee help the moment they need it;\\n\\nPersonalize support for every new hire;\\n\\nConstantly improve our onboarding process; and\\n\\nEnsure employees are productive on Day One.\\n\\nGive new hires what they need. Now.\\n\\nOn Day One, a new hire has a million things to do. From enrolling in benefits and getting the right hardware to figuring out the VPN and even getting their hands on some swag, the Day One to-do list seems endless — especially when they don’t know who is who, where that one conference room is, and why their Zoom keeps disconnecting 40 minutes into every meeting.\\n\\nAt Moveworks, our own chatbot — m8 — takes all the effort and complexity out of first-day busywork. Have a question about benefits? Ask the bot. Need a Zoom Pro license? Ask the bot. Want to make sure your first paycheck is going to the right account? m8 lives right in Slack, ready to help.\\n\\nFigure 1:\\xa0m8 understands what new hires are looking for, even if they’re new to Moveworks and don’t know who or how to ask for help.\\n\\nNot only does m8 have all the answers, it engages conversationally, interpreting an employee’s needs with natural language understanding (NLU). For example, m8 understands that when an employee has a question about payroll, they will need help from our Compensation team. It shouldn’t be the responsibility of any employee, let alone a new one, to know all the ins and outs of something that isn’t their job. With conversational AI, if an employee doesn’t yet know a specific company’s terminology, they can still get what they need immediately.\\n\\nIncorporating a conversational AI strategy into your onboarding program keeps new hires from waiting for answers. When you put all the information they need at their fingertips, they’ll feel like a part of the team in no time.\\n\\nOnboarding is personal. Make sure it stays that way.\\n\\nIn our hybrid world, a well-planned onboarding program is personalized, taking into account that people work in different time zones, speak different languages, and live in different countries. One-size-fits-all onboarding can easily confuse your new hires, leading them to quit.\\n\\nAt Moveworks, we use our bot m8 to deliver a customized support experience — tailored to each employee. m8 knows when someone is a new hire. It knows their title, department, function, cost center, and seniority. It knows where they live and even the language they speak. And because m8 never sleeps, it’s available to help even when it’s 2 AM at HQ.\\n\\nFigure 2: m8 speaks our employee languages, personalizing support to their location, department, and more.\\n\\nSince our platform has access to thousands of support resources, m8 can provide the right solution to employees’ requests, such as snippets from knowledge articles in half a dozen languages. They can not only check remaining PTO balances and inquire about benefits, but can also review company holiday schedules and learn more about maternity leave without confusion, since they know that information is tailored to their region, and not HQ.\\n\\nEmployees can even take action over the bot. Requesting PTO, updating benefits, and signing up for parental leave only take a simple conversation with the bot. No one has to waste time finding and learning how to use various backend HR tools.\\n\\nGet the information you need to improve your onboarding.\\n\\nLet’s be real for a minute. You most likely already have an onboarding process in place. Here’s a question, though: Is it working? If you don’t know what’s working — and what’s not — you’ll never improve.\\n\\nThis is just another way we rely on m8. We regularly review our Performance Insights Dashboards to break down engagement with our bot in real time. We can see what employees are asking in their first week. We know when new hires are having trouble getting office access, need help setting up their 401k, or have questions about our parental leave policy.\\n\\nBecause we know what employees are asking, we can adjust accordingly, building resources or reaching out directly to ensure people get everything they need to succeed.\\n\\nFigure 3: With the insights provided by our dashboards, we know how to best improve our onboarding process.\\n\\nHere’s the situation: You want to hire the best people. The challenge is keeping the best people. And that starts on Day One. In a tight labor market, onboarding shouldn’t be an afterthought. You only have one shot to make a good impression, so you’d best take a long look at your Day One onboarding plan.\\n\\nWhen done correctly, onboarding can engage your new hires, lower your turnover rate, increase retention, build employee loyalty, and sustain motivation. But this success hinges on you being there for your employees. At Moveworks, we rely on our own tech — our bot, m8. This way, new hires have everything they need to succeed in their role on Day One.\\n\\nRequest a demo to see how you can onboard new hires with conversational AI.\\n\\nonboarding\\n\\nMore blog posts\\n\\nHow to unlock continual service improvement with AIOps\\n      \\n        \\n          Discover how AIOps transforms IT operations from reactive to proactive.

This holds especially true for the public sector. Even a small issue can impact critical operations and services, resulting in consequences that affect numerous citizens.\\n\\nThis challenge, combined with the growing demand for conversational AI which is fueled in part by the surge in advanced large language models and tools like ChatGPT, offers a means to tackle everyday disruptions and streamline the employee experience.\\n\\nThat’s why I’m excited to announce Moveworks’ new strategic partnership with Carahsoft. Carahsoft will be the Master Government Aggregator® for Moveworks, making our trusted, secure conversational AI platform available to the public sector.\\n\\nWorking together, we can bring conversational AI to government organizations in a way that meets their specific needs and high security standards. And we can empower employees to engage with various systems and resources seamlessly through natural language, minimizing distractions and maximizing productivity in the workplace.\\n\\nToday, I’ll set out two key areas where this partnership will make a big impact for government support teams and employees:\\n\\nStreamlining support across systems\\n\\nProactively addressing potential issues\\n\\nSurface the right solutions\\n\\nEmployees everywhere face disruptions on the regular. Slow computer startups, email issues, and finding HR policy information amidst thousands of pages of documentation all cause delays and frustration in day-to-day work.\\n\\nMoveworks closes the gap between employees and the systems they engage with. By providing a single platform for assistance and leveraging advanced AI, like OpenAI's GPT-4, Moveworks automates support processes from start to finish. This helps eliminate the need for employees to master multiple systems and applications, allowing them to access resources through the most natural asset: Language.\\n\\nFigure 1: When an employee needs information, Moveworks can instantly surface the resources needed to solve the problem.\\n\\nFor example, an employee messages Moveworks saying they need to add a dependent to their healthcare plan. Moveworks’ natural language understanding (NLU) interprets this message, surfacing next steps.\\n\\nThis is just one example of how Moveworks can help connect and surface information from backend HR, IT, finance, and facilities systems. Some additional examples include:\\n\\nTroubleshooting technical issues in public service infrastructure\\n\\nSurfacing knowledge articles on relevant regulations and guidelines\\n\\nSummarizing, categorizing, and triaging requests and inquiries to the right experts\\n\\nIssuing software and hardware to government employees\\n\\nManaging account and group access and approvals for public sector systems\\n\\nAddressing facility issues and concerns\\n\\nThe Moveworks-Carahsoft partnership allows public sector employees to help themselves, reducing stress on overburdened support teams and allowing everyone to focus on strategic projects without interruption.\\n\\nResolve issues proactively\\n\\nMoveworks not only addresses real-time issues but also helps prevent problems from occurring in the first place.\\n\\nWhen the AI detects an issue or an upcoming password expiration, it proactively prompts employees to take action. These targeted notifications prevent problems from escalating and reaching the service desk, eliminating downtime and lightening the load on support teams.\\n\\nIn this way, Moveworks can eliminate preventable downtime for public sector employees — while also scratching tasks off support teams’ to-do lists.\\n\\nFigure 2: Moveworks notifies employees proactively, helping prevent disruptions before they happen.\\n\\nFor example, when credentials expire unexpectedly, workflows can be disrupted. Moveworks tracks password expiration dates and intelligently sends reminders to employees, preventing future issues.\\n\\nThis is just one example where Moveworks can engage with employees proactively. Some other examples include:\\n\\nSending interactive employee communications that inspire action\\n\\nProviding recommendations for improving the support experience\\n\\nManaging security and compliance in line with government standards\\n\\nCreating tailored onboarding programs for specific departments and government roles\\n\\nSurfacing actionable alerts for employees right where they work\\n\\nDistributing wellness surveys to personnel for promoting employee wellbeing\\n\\nMoveworks joins the trusted list of Carahsoft vendors to support the public sector\\n\\nIt's crucial for the public sector to adopt innovative solutions to keep operations running smoothly, reduce potential downtime, and maintain public trust.\\n\\nBy leveraging conversational AI platforms for internal support, government employees can efficiently navigate systems, enhance productivity, and alleviate support team workloads.\\n\\nThis robust collaboration between Moveworks and Carahsoft guarantees the readiness and trustworthiness essential for serving the government and its workforce. I have complete confidence in Carahsoft's remarkable history of supporting public sector agencies at federal, state, and local levels, as well as in education and healthcare.\\n\\nUltimately, our unified efforts empower businesses and support teams to continuously improve and exceed employee expectations in the digital workplace experience.\\n\\nMoveworks is the leading enterprise conversational AI platform\\n\\nChatGPT wasn’t made to help you improve the employee experience; Moveworks was.\\n\\nAs the only SaaS conversational AI provider to be successfully deployed in Microsoft Government Community Cloud High (GCC-H) Teams, Moveworks is uniquely able to serve the public sector's needs for a secure, compliant, and scalable conversational AI solution for employee support and more.\\n\\nAnd we're not stopping there. We’re focused on building the world’s leading conversational AI platform. We’re constantly innovating, plugged into the latest advances in the field, and looking for ways to improve our platform.\\n\\nToday, we offer what I — and our customers — truly believe to be the best conversational AI platform for the public sector:\\n\\nEnterprise-grade security: Moveworks is committed to safeguarding your organization's sensitive data with the highest levels of security and compliance while delivering exceptional AI-driven experiences for employees.\\n\\nEnterprise understanding: Our platform understands employees' needs, regardless of the language they use, right out of the box.

Yelp uses our location to recommend a hole-in-the-wall sushi place right down the block. Spotify learns our unique preferences to design the perfect workout playlist. Everything is personalized. In fact, in many cases, customized tech is no longer just a luxury: we need personalization to sort through our endless choices.\\n\\nthere’s way too much information for these agents to remember. With every employee relying on a constantly changing array of SaaS applications, email groups, and passwords, it would take a superhuman IT team to keep up.\\n\\nFigure 1: Personalized IT support requires a comprehensive understanding of every employee.\\n\\nAt Moveworks, we’ve tackled this simple problem with a solution that took our engineers years to perfect: an enterprise identity map. Our identity system automatically creates and maintains a comprehensive map for each of our customers’ employees — without any effort involved from the service desk. Using those maps, the Moveworks bot can then resolve IT issues in seconds, informed by deep, user-specific knowledge about the issue at hand.\\xa0\\nIn this blog, we’ll explore:\\n\\nWhat it takes to build an enterprise identity system\\n\\nHow unique identity maps allow Moveworks to deliver personalized support\\n\\nWhy service desks depend on personalization to manage complex IT environments\\n\\nWhat is an enterprise identity system?\\n\\nAt its core, our identity system answers the question, “How can we use information about employees to solve their IT issues?”\\n\\nTech support relies on harnessing contextual information from many sources to fix employee issues. Something as simple as answering a question about company policy often requires extensive background knowledge of the employee, including her location, department, seniority, role, and more. And to address the full scope of all IT issues, we need a 360-degree view of every player in the company.\\n\\nFor Moveworks, that 360-degree view takes the form of a user-specific enterprise identity map that brings together everything from the email addresses stored in Active Directory to the support histories tracked by ServiceNow. Because not even a dedicated team of IT professionals can document all this information, we knew we needed to take a different approach.\\n\\nThat’s why Moveworks spent a significant amount of time and effort to develop our identity system, which consolidates relevant data to create an identity map automatically. We gather disparate information from across a company’s backend IT systems, from Okta to Active Directory to ServiceNow. Each of these systems has access to important user information, but none of them have a complete profile. With our automated approach, every time something changes within these siloed systems, Moveworks updates the employee’s single, centralized map — turning data into actionable intelligence.\\n\\nFigure 2: Continuously updating employee identity maps creates a virtuous cycle,\\n\\nallowing Moveworks to deliver personalized IT support.\\n\\nWhile service desk agents are experts at synthesizing lots of contextual information to resolve IT issues, each new issue forces them to spend minutes, or even hours, tracking down that information. Moveworks’ identity system mirrors this intuition to help employees — but with the advantage of instant access to their identity maps. Of course, this is easier said than done. Upkeep on this identity system means updating millions of names, roles, email groups, locations, and titles. Since all these data points are constantly changing, we need to regularly update these profiles throughout the day.\\n\\nConsider Figure 2, in which Ellen asks to add Nick and Steve to a Slack channel. An IT agent would ask Ellen several follow-up questions to disambiguate the request: which Nick; which Steve; which channel? But Moveworks’ core automation platform, supported by our identity system, can add Nicolas Addams and Stephen Billings to the #dev-ops Slack channel. Service Desks get this type of frustrating and time-consuming employee request daily, and an intelligent identity system takes this tedious work off of their hands.\\n\\nCustomizing tech support with enterprise identity maps\\n\\nIt goes without saying that many companies are looking for automation tools. Service desks try to automatically solve as many IT issues as possible, recognizing that a manual approach is frustrating and time-consuming. Logically, many IT teams have implemented solutions to troubleshoot issues with employees. Yet, the majority of these solutions rely on preprogrammed conversations: a user mentions a topic which then triggers a fixed response.\\n\\nWhile these approaches lack personalization, we here at Moveworks are uniquely positioned to deliver the right answers to the right people by combining conversational AI with a deep understanding of identity. Service desks already have the backend information they need to automate IT — the challenge is that the effort involved in mapping this information to each employee request is formidable.\\n\\nEvery action Moveworks takes is informed by our enterprise identity system. By aggregating data points from across all of these enterprise systems, this identity system ensures individual employees get answers based on the most up-to-date information about themselves and their broader IT environment.\\n\\nFigure 3:\\n\\nTo deliver personalized IT support, Moveworks combines user information from across the IT tech stack.\\n\\nLet’s take a look at our identity system in action:\\n\\nSending the right reminders\\n\\nThe simplest example of how much information service desks have to manage is authentication. For a company with tens of thousands of employees — each with dozens of passwords — the easiest solution is to send everyone a blanket reminder to update their credentials. But people tend to ignore information irrelevant to them.\\n\\nWith our identity map, it’s possible to send timely and contextual reminders. Looking at timezone and password expiration dates, Moveworks knows when is the best day and time to ping employees to change their passwords, avoiding lockouts and future IT issues. The key to delivering information in a way that inspires action is to tailor that information specific to an individual.\\n\\nFigure 4:\\n\\nAn identity system makes it easy to be proactive when it comes to expiring credentials.\\n\\nIdentifying the right people\\n\\nChances are you know a lot of people named Chris. When an employee asks to add Chris to an email group or needs to look up her phone number, service desks have their work cut out for them to determine which Chris is the right one. But with an identity system, it’s possible to immediately understand why Andrea, an accountant, is looking for information on Christine, a financial analyst, and not Christopher, an engineer.\\n\\nFigure 5: Identity maps help disambiguate contacts with the same or similar names.\\n\\nDetermining the right resources\\n\\nDeeply integrating identity into IT automation means that information is always up to date. By incorporating information from Active Directory, for example, our system knows whether an employee has access to a software license. So, when a newly hired employee asks for access to Tableau, the system can either automatically provision it or, alternatively, the system can nudge that employee’s manager to approve the application manually, depending on that employee’s permissions.\\n\\nFigure 6:\\n\\nConsidering an employee’s security permissions allows Moveworks to securely provide resources like software, without involving the service desk.\\n\\nProviding the right answers\\n\\nWhen it comes to questions on company policy — travel guidelines, for example — the right answer depends on an employee’s location. Using our identity map, we know exactly where employees are located, so we can offer a highly personalized, specific answer.\\n\\nFigure 7:\\n\\nKeeping track of an employee’s location, department, and other information,\\n\\na chatbot can surface information relevant to a specific employee.\\n\\nThe necessity of personalized support\\n\\nPersonalization is the only way that an employee can make sense of all the information, tools, and systems at their disposal. Remembering the details of every little update is impossible, but with the information contained in an enterprise identity map, relevant and actionable IT support is only a question away.\\n\\nPersonalization is the missing link between employees and automation. With a contextual, 360-degree identity map, employees get their IT issues resolved immediately. And the service desk has the time to improve their IT environment — knowing that every improvement will automatically be incorporated into the identity system.\\n\\nContact  Moveworks to learn how AI can supercharge your workforce productivity.\\n\\nproduct features\\n\\nMore blog posts\\n\\nHow to unlock continual service improvement with AIOps\\n      \\n        \\n          Discover how AIOps transforms IT operations from reactive to proactive.

The platform now automatically resolves employees\\' HR requests, including benefits inquiries, PTO applications, payroll questions, and more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\nEmployees receive personalized support based on their unique role, location, and language preference.\\n\\nThe shift to flexible work has created enormous challenges for HR teams, since employees expect to stay productive, informed, and fulfilled from anywhere in the world. These employees overwhelm HR with thousands of requests, at all hours of the day, and they continue to quit at a record rate\\xa0as their companies struggle to support them. Moveworks for HR solves these challenges at scale — with AI that provides instant, personalized help to every employee based on their unique role, department, seniority, benefits, location, and language.\\n\\n\"Moveworks is the core of our digital workplace, since it lets employees access support for the broader tech stack with a single search,\" said Steve Phillpott, CIO and CDO at Solidigm. \"Our job is about using technology to empower and improve the employee experience — whether they need IT support or HR help or more. That\\'s what we\\'ve achieved with Moveworks.\"\\n\\nMoveworks for HR is an out-of-the-box solution that requires no added work for HR teams. It plugs into a company\\'s preferred communications platform — Slack, Microsoft Teams, or a company portal, for instance — and automatically responds to each unique request with a personalized response. To provide the best possible answer, Moveworks\\' machine learning models automatically ingest, scan, standardize, annotate, and conversationalize every knowledge article, form, FAQ page, and user record across an enterprise.\\n\\nWith this new release, HR teams can:\\n\\nResolve common employee requests automatically: Employees can check remaining PTO balances, inquire about benefits, payroll, company holiday schedules, human resources information system (HRIS) questions, and more.\\nAccelerate resolution time for complex issues: Employees go to a single place for PTO approvals, life event changes, employee verification letter requests, and more. Moveworks routes the request to the appropriate person for approvals and recommends the best action for the employee and the approver.\\nDramatically increase ROI for existing HR systems: Employees no longer have to ask their HR team to access information buried within HR systems and disparate knowledge bases. By connecting Moveworks to these existing systems, such as ServiceNow, Jira, Workday, SharePoint, Simpplr, Guru, and Confluence, among others, the platform can deliver the best possible solution in a single message.\\n\\n\"HR teams are responsible for every aspect of the employee experience, from onboarding new hires to handling major life events,\" said Moveworks CEO Bhavin Shah. \"This has become a near-impossible job in our complex digital world — further complicated by the fact that employees now expect instant support while working from anywhere and everywhere. HR teams need the help of sophisticated AI to overcome their organization\\'s biggest challenges, while still ensuring employees still get the personalized HR support they need.\"\\n\\nMoveworks for HR uses hundreds of machine learning models to decide the best possible response or action for each specific user, considering their location, language preference, security permissions, and a variety of other factors. Employees simply ask for what they need, however they want, in whatever language they desire.\\n\\n\"We support over 1,000 team members across the globe with different needs and circumstances,\" said Lainey Dailo, HR Operations Manager at Solidigm. \"Moveworks navigates this complexity for us, which means our people get the personal touch they expect from HR, but without having to wait. To create an incredible employee experience, you need the combination of HR and AI.\"\\n\\nMoveworks for HR is a critical addition to the Moveworks platform. Moveworks customers already had the ability to answer questions across any line of business, send interactive comms at scale, and get insights across the entire digital business. With the addition of Moveworks for HR, businesses can resolve HR issues automatically — without the need for manual intervention.\\n\\nTo schedule a demo of Moveworks for HR, visit: https://www.moveworks.com/request-demo\\n\\nAbout Moveworks\\n\\nMoveworks is the AI platform that powers the best places to work.\\n\\nToday, employees deal with endless distractions: they wait days to get IT support, search through dozens of systems to find the new HR policy, and don\\'t learn about critical changes until it\\'s too late.

When a process works well, it feels smooth and efficient. There’s a clear sense of purpose and direction, and each step flows logically from the one that came before it. But, when a process is slow and cumbersome, productivity plummets, costs rise, and employees burn out.\\n\\nThat’s why employee-facing teams, such as IT and HR, are always looking for ways to improve their processes. Often faced with a heavy workload and limited resources, these teams increasingly lean on a variety of tools to help them organize a constant flood of internal requests.\\n\\nImplementing help desk forms is one way to alleviate pressure on these teams. Forms offer an opportunity to streamline the support process and redesign the experience to be more user-friendly. No matter the size of your company, easy-to-access, well-built forms can revolutionize clumsy, time-consuming processes and provide massive time savings for both support teams and employees alike.\\n\\nIn this post, we’ll break down how three companies — DocuSign, Palo Alto Networks, and Procore — upgraded their support processes by optimizing help desk forms in three key ways:\\n\\nMaking help desk forms easy to find\\n\\nMaking help desk forms easy to fill\\n\\nImproving help desk forms with continuous feedback\\n\\nWhy create help desk forms?\\n\\nHelp desk forms bring a company’s service catalog to life by making support resources easily accessible to employees. High-quality help desk forms have cascading benefits: They provide the information needed to reduce the amount of back and forth between support teams and employees, they route issues to the right experts, and they drastically reduce the amount of time it takes to deliver help.\\n\\nBy filling out a form, an employee can request software, replace hardware, add a new teammate to a distribution list, update healthcare benefits, verify employment, and update a record in Salesforce. And for the help desk, forms are a great way to collect structured information from users, making it easier and faster to deliver a response.\\n\\nDocuSign helps employees find forms\\n\\nEmployees don’t know where to go for help. IT has its systems. HR has other systems. And both these teams are continually adding new forms, knowledge articles, and software tools. So, it’s no surprise that employees are often unaware of the breadth of information at their fingertips.\\n\\nThat’s why DocuSign made the entire help desk form experience conversational. Instead of scrolling through a portal, employees can explain their issues to a virtual agent with natural language via Slack. Forms across teams from IT to HR are centralized, making it easy for employees to find what they need. And the virtual agent’s AI eliminates confusion by offering employees the option to simply explain their problem, without worrying about whether it’s an IT or HR or payroll issue.\\n\\nFigure 1:\\n\\nDocuSign’s virtual agent understands what employees need and pulls the right form from the service catalog.\\n\\nNow, the primary way DocuSign’s employees access support resources is through help desk forms, which allow agents to quickly deliver the best resolution. Every month, the virtual agent surfaces more than 350 forms in under two seconds, ensuring that much-needed solutions are only a message away.\\n\\nPalo Alto Networks fills forms in chat\\n\\nForms can be long and tedious. Spending any amount of time filling in the same, basic information or scrolling through drop-down menus takes precious time from more meaningful work.\\n\\nBecause forms are such a crucial element of their self-service support strategy, Palo Alto Networks made it possible for employees to fill out and submit forms via chat. Whether an employee reaches out on Slack or the ServiceNow portal, the form-filling experience is personalized to each specific requestor since the virtual agent automatically syncs the user’s location, permissions, and conversation history across various support channels. In some cases, an employee only needs to fill out a single field. The virtual agent takes care of the rest.\\n\\nFigure 2: At Palo Alto Networks, a virtual agent makes it easy for employees to fill out forms conversationally in Slack, the company’s enterprise chat platform.\\n\\nMassively reducing friction within the form-filling process makes employees more inclined to complete the process, minimizing the amount of work for the IT team and accelerating solutions. This ultimately adds up to thousands of issues automatically solved every month and hundreds of thousands of hours of productivity saved.\\n\\nForms speed up support at Procore\\n\\nResource gaps are difficult to identify. It’s hard for support teams to determine which resources employees need without visibility into employee requests.\\n\\nIn an effort to improve their own forms, support teams at Procore regularly dig into help desk form usage data, highlighting where they have good forms, bad forms, or no forms at all, so they can fill in the gaps. Thinking about the most common services requested by employees over the last week, month, and three months, agents break down patterns, then create new forms or update old ones to keep up with demand.\\n\\nFigure 3:\\n\\nLooking to speed up support, Procore prioritizes the creation of new help desk forms to address common pain points, such as adding a contractor to a distribution list, based on user feedback.\\n\\nProcore’s service desk works to constantly improve its backend systems, creating a positive feedback loop between what employees need and the resources that are available to them. By paying attention to what’s going on in its support environment, Procore’s support team can prioritize building that content so their virtual agent can answer more questions and, at the end of the day, resolve more issues. Currently, help desk forms are used to provision software automatically almost 50 times a month alone. And this number will continue to grow as the team continues to create more, high quality help desk forms.\\n\\nHelp desk forms give people back time\\n\\nForms can open your organization to a whole new world of workplace efficiency. Instead of spending hours each day troubleshooting a VPN connection, waiting around for software access, or jerry-rigging a troublesome standing desk, employees at DocuSign, Palo Alto Networks, and Procore are getting the support they need with help desk forms.\\n\\nOf course, support teams benefit too! Focusing on help desk forms massively impacts the service desk’s ability to automate hundreds of solutions, saving hours upon hours of productivity.\\n\\nSee for yourself how AI-powered help desk forms save time.

But with workforces scattered around the world, providing around-the-clock support in every language and on every channel just isn't feasible.\\n\\nOur goal at Moveworks is to give every employee the immediate support they deserve — no matter how they prefer to get help or which language they speak. That’s why we’re so excited to make two huge announcements today.\\n\\nFirst: Moveworks is now multilingual. Our platform offers deep, native support for employees who speak Spanish, Italian, German, French, and Portuguese, in addition to English.\\n\\nAnd second: We’re introducing Moveworks for Web. Now, Moveworks can provide the same instant support experience directly inside enterprise portals, including ServiceNow, SharePoint, and Epic.\\n\\nThese announcements will help usher in a new normal for companies with global teams. Our unique approach to multilingual support is purpose-built to tackle every step of solving support issues, from engaging with employees to providing the resources they need. And by expanding Moveworks to new communication channels, we've allowed you to support your people, anytime and anywhere.\\n\\nRead the full announcement here →\\n\\nMoveworks is multilingual\\n\\nFigure 1: Employees deserve the same quality of support — no matter where they are or which language they speak.\\n\\nFor non-English speakers, getting help at work can be hard. Something as simple as troubleshooting a VPN connection or figuring out how to request time-off is extremely frustrating when a language barrier stands between an employee and the answer they need. Emailing an English-speaking service desk, navigating an English-only portal, or working through a dead-end dialog flow can derail an employee’s entire day.\\n\\nFor help desks, there's no existing solution designed to automate support for a global workforce. Conventional chatbots, for instance, involve an enormous, expensive, and endless effort to hardcode conversations in each language — and then require even more effort to continuously update each dialog, in each language as things change over time.\\n\\nNow with Moveworks, every one of your employees instantly gets the same access to support, no matter what language they speak.\\xa0 We evolved the entire Moveworks Intelligence Engine™ to become multilingual at every step of solving an issue. Our platform:\\n\\nSeamlessly engages with employees in their preferred language\\n\\nDeeply understands support issues in any language\\n\\nDelivers personalized solutions to every request\\n\\nCritically, our multilingual support gets to work resolving issues with zero setup or maintenance by support teams. And since Moveworks automatically improves itself by incorporating new resources and supporting new use cases, employees continue to get what they need to stay productive.\\n\\nRead a deep dive on our unique and powerful approach to multilingual support →\\n\\nIntroducing Moveworks for Web\\n\\nFigure 2: Moveworks for Web ensures every employee gets the help they need — on whichever platform they prefer.\\n\\nEmployees should have access to the same instant help, no matter which channel they depend on. But for many of us, manually filing a support ticket in an ITSM tool or searching through a self-service portal is a waste of time. These systems aren’t always built with end-users in mind.\\n\\nAt Moveworks, we first focused on supporting employees in the enterprise messaging tools, such as Slack and Microsoft Teams, that they use every day. That said, our goal is to make getting help at work effortless, wherever people\\xa0go. We recognize that employees have different preferences and habits, with about 25% who rely on enterprise portals as their primary support channel.\\n\\nSo we decided to expand Moveworks’ reach with Moveworks for Web, which delivers support across many\\xa0popular enterprise portals. With today’s launch, employees will have access to the same, high-quality Moveworks experience, directly inside\\xa0ServiceNow, SharePoint, and Epic. It offers:\\n\\nThe same conversational AI interface in the enterprise portal\\n\\nNotifications and communications that follow users across platforms\\n\\nA fully secure\\xa0experience, without a separate authentication process\\n\\nAbove all, Moveworks for Web means that employees can get instant help, however they choose to work.\\n\\nHere at Moveworks, we're committed to making support effortless. Both multilingual support and Moveworks for Web play a massive role in transforming typically frustrating and time-consuming employee problems into simple conversations. Moving forward, we’ll continue to support even more languages and enterprise portals to solve support issues faster, no matter the complexity.\\n\\nRequest a demo to see how Moveworks can transform your support process.\\n\\nproduct features\\n\\nMore blog posts\\n\\nHow to unlock continual service improvement with AIOps\\n      \\n        \\n          Discover how AIOps transforms IT operations from reactive to proactive.

We take pride in creating big, ambitious plans to improve the employee experience, from team trips to new benefits to leadership training.\\n\\nBut the truth is small moments define how employees experience HR — much more than these big ideas. Whether employees need to track down the latest travel policy, enroll in healthcare benefits, or simply look up a colleague’s phone number, small moments cause immense frustration when they disrupt the workday.\\n\\nAt Moveworks, our HR team has a strong perspective about what it takes to create a world-class culture. Ultimately, though, I believe we were named the number one Best Place to Work in the Bay Area because we’re dedicated to eliminating the minor inconveniences that make or break the HR experience. Taking the friction out of the workday involves a company-wide commitment with buy-in across every team. And today, I’ll explain three actionable steps you can take to make your workplace the best workplace:\\n\\nShift focus from one-on-one help to self-service resources\\n\\nInvest in automation for HR service delivery\\n\\nPrevent small issues from becoming big ones with actionable employee comms\\n\\nCreate easy-to-consume resources\\n\\nOne-on-one conversations to fix common issues are well-intentioned. But the best way to make things easier is to help employees help themselves.\\n\\nBy shifting your attention away from individual support and focusing instead on building simple, self-service resources, you’ll have more time to scale those impactful “big idea” initiatives. I speak from experience — going from 70 to 400 employees in less than two years has taught me that HR needs a way to address thousands of questions at once.\\n\\nFigure 1: When resources are easily understood, employees help themselves.\\n\\nThe thing is, an employee can better understand a clear paragraph that covers a single topic than a hundred-page employee handbook. By organizing resources into an easy-to-consume format and investing in the right tools, employees will be able to pinpoint a specifically relevant snippet of information within a trove of massive documents, all on their own.\\xa0This way, when an employee asks HR about their paid time-off, paternity leave, or clarifications on the expense policy, there’s a resource that allows them to answer their own question.\\n\\nAutomate routine support issues\\n\\nHR teams have been tasked with ensuring employees are safe in the face of a fast-moving and seemingly never-ending pandemic. With policies constantly changing, just keeping up is enough of a challenge for a team that’s already spread thin. The idea of building resources to respond to endless questions and requests sounds like an impossibility until you realize that those resources hold the keys to automation.\\n\\nFigure 2: Answer common questions in seconds with AI.\\n\\nFor years, the sheer complexity of HR service delivery prevented companies from even trying to automate it. That said, the good news is that automated support platforms have become much smarter of late. AI-powered platforms are increasingly able to understand the language employees use to ask for help, including the unique terms and systems found within your particular company. It’s even possible for a bot to pull a personalized solution from resources scattered across dozens of knowledge bases, handbooks, and other documentation.\\n\\nNow more than ever, it’s crucial to get people the support they need immediately. With automation, you can help set up vaccine bookings, explain return-to-office policies, and answer a multitude of FAQs related to the pandemic in seconds. Not to mention that automation can also help with more conventional duties, like onboarding new employees and setting up a new 401K plan. Being a health services expert wasn’t in our charter, but with AI, we’ve been able to keep up during a time of intense and rapid change.\\n\\nCommunicate proactively\\n\\nAt this point, you’ve made the small moments a lot less frustrating by improving resources and automating support. With this foundation, you can stop issues before they happen by sending actionable employee communications.\\n\\nThe root of many support requests is change. Launching a new 401(k) program is great, for instance, but only if employees know how to enroll. Every time you launch a new system or update a policy, employees will flood your team with questions that could have been prevented.\\n\\nFigure 3: Send actionable messages to prevent issues before they happen.\\n\\nTo stop the deluge, first, you need a way to give every employee actionable next steps. When my team sends a comm, we give employees the resources they need to complete the task — whether it’s filling out a form, linking to a portal, or reading the latest travel policy — directly in the message.\\n\\nSecond, know that even when employees do read your messages, they’ll inevitably have questions. Here’s where your painstakingly created resources and automation tools step in. An AI-powered chatbot can engage with each employee individually and handle all the follow-ups and back-and-forth on your behalf, surfacing answers, so you don’t have to.\\n\\nSmall moments matter\\n\\nHR’s role in company culture is to spend thousands of hours onboarding new hires, providing top-notch benefits, and fostering a company culture that empowers everyone. The problem? Employees don’t feel connected to their company. And with the rise of remote and hybrid work — they are literally disconnected from the people, systems, and resources they rely on for support.\\n\\nThat’s why it’s a big deal when minor things take a huge amount of time and effort. The best HR teams will make the pivotal shift to improving the small, but impactful, moments of everyday work. If done well, this means both employees and support teams will spend less time solving support issues and more time on meaningful projects. With the right strategies, you can create a culture where no one sweats the small stuff.\\n\\nCheck out our Careers to help Moveworks build the best HR experience.\\n\\nbest practices\\n\\nCOVID-19\\n\\nemployee experience\\n\\nWant to learn more?\\n\\nWorking at Moveworks means working alongside a team of winners - making an impact, every day.

Moveworks will provide Lucid employees the answers to their most pressing IT questions in a matter of seconds — allowing IT agents to focus on projects that will drive the business forward.\\n\\nIt costs an average of $22 to manually handle an IT service desk request. While seemingly innocuous, this number quickly adds up when service desk agents are sifting through thousands of requests a month. And, while self-service IT tickets cost the business a fraction of this number, many employees either don’t know where knowledge exists within their business, or they don’t know where or how to find it. This leaves employees frustrated by a confusing self-service process and leaves IT teams stuck manually resolving the same requests over and over again.\\n\\nThat’s why Lucid chose Moveworks: To maximize ROI on its existing knowledge base by offering employees a streamlined, automated self-service IT solution that actually delivers on its promise.\\n\\n“As our team has grown, we’ve put a significant amount of time and effort into developing knowledge articles that address employees’ most common IT questions. But those efforts ultimately go to waste if no one ever uses them,” said David Torgerson, VP of infrastructure and IT at Lucid Software. “In order to see a return on those efforts, we're excited to use Moveworks' AI platform. With its sophisticated intelligence, the platform interprets employees' needs with high confidence and delivers the most accurate responses, helping our Lucid IT teams to focus on more complex problems and work more efficiently.”\\n\\nMoveworks uses advanced AI to index existing knowledge articles and deliver the best possible response to employees’ questions. It corrects spelling, analyzes user intent, and takes into account each employees’ location, role, permissions, and language preference. Employees simply ask the Moveworks bot a question within Slack, and Moveworks either resolves the request automatically or routes it to the appropriate expert for accelerated resolution — all within seconds. With the help of Moveworks, Lucid will be able to scale IT support at the pace required to keep up with its growing team, without having to significantly increase service desk headcount as a result.\\n\\n“Most self-service solutions lead employees to frustrating dead ends,” said Bhavin Shah, CEO of Moveworks. “That’s because yielding accurate results would require the employee to use the exact keywords used in the exact knowledge article they’re looking for. This just isn’t a realistic expectation. In reality, every employee asks for help in different ways — they often have typos, are missing context, or are incredibly vague. In order for a self-service solution to deliver accurate results, it needs to be able to navigate this endless nuance in real-time. And that’s exactly what Moveworks does.”\\n\\nAside from maximizing ROI on Lucid’s knowledge base, Moveworks will streamline internal processes with automated workflows. It will reset passwords, provision software, pass along policy updates, update permissions, request or troubleshoot hardware, and look up people or places — all within Slack so employees don’t need to leave their preferred communication platform.\\n\\nTo schedule a demo of Moveworks, visit: https://www.moveworks.com/request-demo\\n\\nMedia Contact\\n\\nSophia Xepoleas, Sr PR Manager\\n\\nEmail:\\n\\npr@moveworks.ai\\n\\nWeb:\\n\\nMoveworks.com/contact\\n\\nSolutions\\n\\nCustomers\\n\\nResources\\n\\nBlog\\n\\nSitemap\\n\\nPlatform\\n\\nPlatform overview\\n\\nMoveworks API\\n\\nSystem status\\n\\nCompany\\n\\nAbout us\\n\\nNewsroom\\n\\nContact us\\n\\nCareers\\n\\n©2023 Moveworks, Inc.\\n\\nPrivacy policies\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.moveworks.com/press-releases/2022/12/moveworks-scales-it-support-for-lucid-software-while-keeping-costs-flat'}),\n",

Now, you can also resolve your support issues, instantly, without ever leaving Teams.\\n\\nThat’s because Moveworks is today announcing its partnership with Microsoft to transform Teams into an autonomous support channel. Employees can submit their IT, HR, Finance, and Facilities issues straight to the Moveworks chatbot in Teams using natural language, which our AI analyzes to deliver the best resolution. From troubleshooting problems, to software requests, to work-from-home questions, and much more, issues that take days for help desk agents to solve can now be solved in seconds — with Moveworks on Teams.\\n\\n“The Moveworks integration will now allow our joint customers to empower their employees to use Microsoft Teams to resolve their most critical support issues, instantly and autonomously.”\\n\\nBhrighu Sareen, Corporate Vice President, Microsoft Teams\\n\\nAn outdated status quo\\n\\nTeams connects coworkers regardless of their physical location, since it brings together all the relevant resources and project participants on a single tool. As a result, the shift to working from home has rendered Teams more critical than ever before. The companies thriving during this period have prioritized the real-time interactions that collaboration hubs make possible — interactions that happen naturally in the office, but which prove difficult to replicate on conventional channels like email.\\n\\nYet when it comes to support, most companies have not implemented this kind of real-time approach, meaning their employees still rely on such conventional channels. Whether these employees email the help desk or try to track down the appropriate form, agents must read through thousands of support requests, before determining which among hundreds of specialized assignment groups can help. The assignment group then emails back and forth with the submitter, often passing the issue off to other groups along the way. It’s a process that takes days, sometimes weeks, to conclude — hindering knowledge workers who depend on their accounts and devices to stay productive while remote.\\n\\nStaying productive from anywhere\\n\\nEnter Moveworks, which brings the real-time interactivity of Teams to employee support. Moveworks applies machine learning and natural language understanding (NLU) to automate every step of the support process, eliminating the delays caused by back-and-forth emails between agent and submitter. The Moveworks bot in Teams is unique in fulfilling many support requests without any agent intervention, via deep integrations with enterprise systems:\\n\\nMicrosoft Active Directory for identity and access management\\n\\nMicrosoft Office 365 for creating and editing distribution lists\\n\\nMicrosoft SharePoint for knowledge\\n\\nMicrosoft System Center Orchestrator for automating workflows\\n\\nITSM platforms such as ServiceNow, Jira, and Zendesk for tracking requests\\n\\nThe Moveworks bot currently resolves more than 40% of all IT support issues at dozens of large enterprises, while our machine learning models continue to improve with every conversation. More than 250\\xa0million support tickets' worth of training later, Moveworks is handling issues like provisioning software right in chat:\\n\\nAnd ordering devices with just a few keystrokes:\\n\\nNo matter where you are, no matter when you need help, and no matter how you ask, Moveworks is there to understand your issue and resolve it within seconds.\\n\\nDriving Teams adoption organically\\n\\nGiven the increasing importance of collaboration hubs, a key benefit of adding Moveworks to Teams is the bot’s proven track record of organically driving up Teams adoption. This was the experience that Equinix — the world’s largest interconnection and colocation platform — had when sunsetting Skype for Business.\\n\\nGreg Ogle, Equinix’s Vice President of Global IT Infrastructure, and his team needed to convince employees to quickly transition from Skype to Teams. As an incentive, they made Moveworks available exclusively in Teams, with the Moveworks chatbot sending employees notifications about their tech issues that led them straight to the new tool. While total employee adoption of Skype never exceeded 25%, adoption of Teams skyrocketed to 75% before Skype was shut down. And thanks in part to Moveworks, Teams adoption rose to more than 90% by the end of last year. Check out the full case study here.\\n\\n“Leveraging the bot helped with our transition to Teams across the company. By the time we finally did shut down Skype, it was a non-event. If you’re a Teams shop, Moveworks can extend the platform and bring it new life.”\\n\\nGreg Ogle, VP of Global IT Infrastructure, Equinix\\n\\nThe future of employee support\\n\\nAs companies embrace the shift to working from home, Teams has become pivotal to workflows across departments and across industries, allowing employees to maintain their productivity and their connections on a unified platform. Moveworks simply lets them get that work done faster, turning days of back-and-forths with the help desk into seconds of painless conversation on Teams. Indeed, even after the world no longer needs to work remotely, this more efficient way of doing business will become the new normal.\\n\\nThe Moveworks and Teams integration signals a decline in button-clicking tasks for service desks and support teams — freeing up manpower for more rewarding, more impactful digital transformation projects. And crucially, that time savings isn’t limited to the issues that AI resolves from end-to-end. At Equinix, for example, Moveworks triages over 3,000 tickets per week on average, which saves the help desk from having to read and route each and every one.\\n\\nLess than a year after launching the bot, Equinix has already witnessed a 32% reduction in the average IT ticket’s lifespan — a figure which continues to climb as Moveworks gets smarter. At Equinix and beyond, the Moveworks integration with Teams allows companies to resolve support issues even faster, and for even more employees.\\n\\nContact Moveworks to demo and deploy our AI chatbot in your Teams environment.\\n\\nnews\\n\\nMore blog posts\\n\\nHow to unlock continual service improvement with AIOps\\n      \\n        \\n          Discover how AIOps transforms IT operations from reactive to proactive.

It should come as no surprise, then, that the market is flooded with a vast array of LLM solutions.\\n\\nWith this constant release of new models from companies like OpenAI and Google,\\n\\nPinpointing the right AI solution for your specific needs requires a clear understanding of each model\\'s capabilities and limitations. And while existing benchmark studies might provide useful insights, they don’t focus on an LLM’s performance in the enterprise environment.\\n\\nThat’s why our team dedicated itself to developing a benchmark explicitly addressing the needs of enterprises. This way, we can offer a more targeted evaluation, guiding leaders so that they can select the AI solution that truly aligns with their objectives.\\n\\nToday, we’re going to break down the results, explaining:\\n\\nThe existing benchmarks for evaluating large language models\\n\\nThe challenges of using existing language model benchmarks for the enterprise\\n\\nThe details of the Moveworks Enterprise LLM Benchmark\\n\\nThe results of the Moveworks Enterprise LLM Benchmark\\n\\nKey takeaways\\n\\nLong story short: A fine-tuned LLM excels in enterprise tasks compared with larger out-of-the-box models\\n\\nThe results of the Moveworks Enterprise LLM Benchmark demonstrate that LLMs fine-tuned on the enterprise dataset surpassed their larger counterparts.\\n\\nGPT models demonstrate impressive reasoning capabilities as well as capabilities to learn from in-context examples. However, in enterprise settings, models have to deal with enterprise-specific jargon and knowledge not available in the generic knowledge encapsulated in public LLMs.\\n\\nFurthermore, in enterprise settings, LLMs are used as a component of a larger system. So, in many cases, the outputs of LLM are expected to be in a structured format that another system can understand. For example, Moveworks uses structured JSON as a canonical output format for span extraction tasks.\\n\\nOne can teach LLMs to handle enterprise-specific knowledge and produce structured output by providing in-context examples in the prompt. However, from our experiments, we have found that LLMs fine-tuned on enterprise-specific tasks and a corpus can understand enterprise-specific language and excel in enterprise-specific tasks as well as a GPT model — even when the model size is 10X smaller!\\n\\nThe key takeaway is that while GPT-class models possess immense power and will undoubtedly play a central role in various AI applications, task-specific models are more reliable than off-the-shelf alternatives.\\n\\nKeep scrolling for the full breakdown 👉\\n\\nCurrent large language model benchmarks\\n\\nAs language models become increasingly essential, establishing accurate performance evaluations is vital. Emerging evaluation resources, such as Stanford\\'s Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) and EleutherAI\\'s LM Evaluation Harness, offer comprehensive frameworks to examine the latest LLMs across various tasks. By employing these evaluative measures, researchers can better understand LLM abilities and drive improvements in the rapidly evolving field of language processing.\\n\\nFor example, two popular benchmarks for testing LLMs like OpenAI’s GPT-4, Databricks’ Dolly, and Facebook’s LLaMA are the AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC) and WinoGrande. The ARC dataset includes a collection of 7,787 science exam questions in English multiple-choice format and plays a significant role in assessing language models\\' reasoning capabilities. On the other hand, the WinoGrande dataset is rooted in the WSC, a set of 273 expert-crafted pronoun resolution problems developed to challenge statistical models that rely on word associations or selectional preferences.\\n\\nThese open-source datasets evaluate LLMs\\' capabilities, especially their zero-shot performance: the ability to adapt and perform well in new, previously unencountered real-world situations without tailor-made training.\\n\\nChallenges of using existing language model benchmarks for the enterprise\\n\\nWhile existing LLM benchmarks serve as valuable resources, there are several issues that arise when using them for enterprise-specific applications. There are three main challenges:\\n\\nLack of enterprise specificity\\n\\nMany existing benchmarks, such as the ARC-e dataset, focus on general knowledge questions. For instance, a question like \"Which factor will most likely cause a person to develop a fever?\" is crucial for evaluating a general LLM. However, it may not provide relevant insights for an enterprise-specific LLM that caters to specialized tasks, like asking where a certain conference room is or requesting a software application.\\n\\nStagnant datasets\\n\\nMost existing datasets are not routinely updated, making it challenging to evaluate advanced and continuously improving LLMs accurately. And as newer LLMs achieve increasingly higher scores, making meaningful comparisons among them becomes problematic.\\n\\nLatest LLMs outperforming benchmarks\\n\\nThe latest LLMs, such as GPT-4, have achieved remarkable scores on popular benchmarks such as ARC and WinoGrande (with GPT-4 scoring 96.3% on ARC and 87.5% on WinoGrande). These high scores highlight the evolving sophistication of LLMs, and the current benchmarks may no longer effectively capture their complete capabilities.\\n\\nEven within our own experiments of understanding these models, we have observed instances where LLM outputs do not match the human evaluation labels. Still, these outputs provide better or more accurate answers. This phenomenon illustrates that advanced LLMs can potentially contribute to refining benchmarks by correcting errors in human evaluation labels and improving the overall formatting of existing datasets.\\n\\nIn light of these challenges, developing newer benchmarks that can cater explicitly to enterprise-specific requirements, accommodate the rapid advancements in LLM technology, and provide a more accurate and nuanced comparison between different models is essential. By addressing these concerns, enterprises can more effectively harness the power of LLMs to drive their specific use cases and needs.\\n\\nIntroducing the Moveworks Enterprise LLM Benchmark\\n\\nTo accurately gauge the performance of various LLMs in enterprise applications, we created the Moveworks Enterprise LLM Benchmark.\\n\\nAt Moveworks, our engineering and in-house annotation teams put a lot of effort into gathering and organizing data specific to the corporate world, including enterprise support tickets, enterprise knowledge, and of course, conversations between employees and their Moveworks bots.\\n\\nThis data was used to evaluate different LLMs so that we could pick the best ones to use. To make this evaluation process efficient, our machine learning engineers converted the data into an easy-to-follow format consisting of instructions and examples of input and output, known as instruction-input-output trios.\\n\\nWe created 14 tasks focusing on essential themes of enterprise use cases — generation, reasoning, relevance, extraction, and classification — with zero-shot to long context inputs, such as the complete enterprise email support ticket. We will continue to add more tasks as we progress in creating a more comprehensive enterprise LLM benchmark.\\n\\nWhich models did we test?\\n\\nTo ensure a comprehensive assessment, we focused on our proprietary dataset of enterprise tasks for benchmarking. We analyzed several models\\' performance, including models such as GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4, and MoveLM™ — Moveworks\\' own proprietary LLM that we\\'re currently building and testing and that will be available across our entire platform in the coming months. These models are instruction-tuned on internal and external datasets to optimize the model\\'s performance on enterprise-specific tasks. The internal Moveworks dataset is a set of 70K instructions generated from enterprise use cases.\\n\\nBase model  name \\n \\n \\n Base model developed by \\n \\n \\n Already instruction-tuned? \\n \\n \\n Fine-tuned on  internal dataset  (Moveworks) \\n \\n \\n Model parameter \\n \\n \\n \\n GPT-3.5 Turbo (ChatGPT) \\n \\n \\n OpenAI \\n \\n \\n ✅ \\n \\n \\n - \\n \\n \\n - \\n \\n \\n \\n GPT-4 \\n \\n \\n ✅ \\n \\n \\n - \\n \\n \\n - \\n \\n \\n \\n GPT-J \\n \\n \\n EleutherAI \\n \\n \\n - \\n \\n \\n - \\n \\n \\n 6B \\n \\n \\n \\n GPT-J Fine-tuned\\xa0 \\n \\n \\n - \\n \\n \\n ✅ \\n \\n \\n 6B \\n \\n \\n \\n StableLM Base \\n \\n \\n Stability AI \\n \\n \\n - \\n \\n \\n - \\n \\n \\n 7B \\n \\n \\n \\n StableLM Fine-tuned \\n \\n \\n - \\n \\n \\n ✅ \\n \\n \\n 7B \\n \\n \\n \\n StableLM OpenAssistant \\n \\n \\n ✅ \\n \\n \\n - \\n \\n \\n 7B \\n \\n \\n \\n Dolly \\n \\n \\n Databricks \\n \\n \\n ✅ \\n \\n \\n - \\n \\n \\n 7B \\n \\n \\n \\n Dolly Fine-tuned \\n \\n \\n ✅ \\n \\n \\n ✅ \\n \\n \\n 7B \\n \\n \\n \\n MPT Instruct \\n \\n \\n MosaicML \\n \\n \\n ✅ \\n \\n \\n - \\n \\n \\n 7B \\n \\n \\n \\n MPT Fine-tuned \\n \\n \\n ✅ \\n \\n \\n ✅ \\n \\n \\n 7B\\n\\nTable 1: Overview of models tested in the Moveworks Enterprise LLM Benchmark\\n\\nDespite countless other impressive fine-tuned models, we narrowed our focus to prevent an overwhelming rundown in this blog post. With our test setup, we sought to challenge the limits of LLMs by posing questions specifically tailored to the enterprise environment. By placing these models in situations they had not previously encountered, we aimed to evaluate their ability to rapidly generate accurate and relevant responses under pressure, similar to “thinking on their feet.”\\n\\nThe results of the Moveworks Enterprise LLM Benchmark\\n\\nLet’s dive into some results of the Benchmark assessment.\\n\\nTicket closing comment helpfulness classification\\n\\nIdentifying helpful ticket comments is critical in understanding the resolution of common issues that arise in enterprise settings. A significant portion of enterprise issues is resolved via tickets. Ticket content, along with its comments, provides extremely useful information about enterprise issues.\\n\\nHowever, many ticket comments are not helpful. Comments like “Closing this ticket” or “Issue has been resolved” do not provide helpful information about resolving the issue. We use AI models to identify ticket-closing comments that include valuable information on how to resolve a specific issue. This information is then used to better understand our users\\' problems in enterprise settings.\\n\\nThe subtlety of \"helpfulness\" can be challenging to navigate. For instance, when an IT agent resolves an issue with Microsoft Business Central and comments, \"Business Central is now working again from links within Workday,\" it indicates the problem has been fixed. Still, it doesn\\'t provide enough information on how to resolve the issue in the long term.\\n\\nConsider the following example cases:\\n\\nIn above example, closing comment — while curt — does include resolution steps on how to update the disk. GPT-3.5 Turbo\\'s output is false, incorrectly identifying the comment as unhelpful. However, MoveLM\\xa0correctly identifies the comment as helpful, providing the true output.\\n\\nIn this instance, while the comment is long, it does not include detailed steps for resolution. GPT-3.5\\xa0Turbo\\'s output is True, wrongly classifying the comment as helpful. But MoveLM\\xa0accurately identifies the comment as unhelpful, returning the true output.\\n\\nThe examples demonstrate MoveLM\\'s capability to discern helpful comments, which contributes to a better understanding and resolution of user issues in enterprise environments.\\n\\nFigure 1: Even though was a zero-shot experiment, MoveLM performed better against few-shot experiments with competing models featured in this benchmark.\\n\\nStakeholder analytics intent classification\\n\\nAt Moveworks, we maintain a fine-grained intent taxonomy covering pairs of actions and resource types that span the entire breadth of enterprise support issues across IT, HR, Finance, Legal domains, and beyond. Our detailed understanding of enterprise intent allows us to provide prescriptive analytics through our flagship data product, Employee Experience Insights (EXI).\\n\\nWithin EXI, we maintain a simplified version of our intent taxonomy that leaders at organizations easily understand, called BART (Business Action Resource Taxonomy). This taxonomy classifies all tickets at an organization into a two-dimensional grid based on the tickets’ action and resource type. At a glance, this shows enterprise leaders a holistic view of the state of tickets across their organization and allows them to drill down into specific hotspots to improve the employee experience.\\n\\nWith our corpus of 500 million enterprise support tickets at Moveworks, our LLMs are fine-tuned on high-quality samples from this corpus and are able to extract nuances that off-the-shelf models do not easily capture.\\n\\nThe above example demonstrates intent classification in the case of a ticket submitted to request a specific form. MoveLM\\xa0model accurately labels the ticket as Provision, signifying that the requested document needs to be shared with the user. On the other hand, GPT-4 marks the same ticket as Manage, failing to recognize the enterprise context.\\n\\nAdditionally, in cases where a ticket refers to a pre-existing ticket, the fine-tuned MoveLM™ model can correctly classify the ticket as Information. In contrast, GPT-4, without proper context, may inaccurately label the ticket as Hardware, further highlighting the advantage of training LLMs on a corpus of enterprise support tickets.\\n\\nFigure 2: Even though was a zero-shot experiment, MoveLM performed better against few-shot experiments with competing models featured in this benchmark.\\n\\nGenerating API calls from natural language\\n\\nEnterprises use and integrate with many systems to organize and manage workflows. Such integrations enable seamless communication and data exchange between different software systems, thus allowing for enhanced efficiency and improved collaboration across other business processes.\\n\\nAt Moveworks, we help our customers automate these mundane and time-consuming processes to unlock their full potential by enabling them to interact with such systems with a conversational interface without worrying about the technical nitty-gritty.\\n\\nAn essential aspect of building such a solution is to be able to predict what system contains the information that a user wants to access and how to retrieve that information from that system. Our models leverage the vast amount of diverse user requests made in the past and the corresponding actions to better understand user queries and handle complex language nuances, thus providing more accurate and contextually relevant responses.\\n\\nConsider two examples where users submit requests to Moveworks:\\n\\nIn the above example, given the query \"What\\'s Moveworks ARR?\" MoveLM successfully understands the user\\'s request and is able to generate an API call given a list of API’s and its descriptions in context. On the other hand, the GPT-4 model incorrectly responds, saying that it doesn\\'t have an API to answer the query.\\n\\nThe example above demonstrates how fine-tuned MoveLM is able to understand enterprise specific context. In this case, the GPT-4 model does not understand from context that ‘Clover’ is a on-site location and mistakenly responds by attempting to retrieve the customer profile for Clover. On the other hand, the MoveLM model correctly identifies the context of the query and fetches site information about Clover, demonstrating its superior understanding of user intent and language subtleties.\\n\\nFigure 1: Even though was a zero-shot experiment, MoveLM performed better against few-shot experiments with competing models featured in this benchmark.\\n\\nKey takeaways of the Moveworks Enterprise LLM Benchmark\\n\\nWe hope that the discussion above drives home the point that LLMs are not going to meet the needs of enterprise AI right out of the box. Observing the qualitative examples above and performance on our Enterprise Benchmark, we are seeing that fine-tuning on high-quality data is necessary. This results in superior performance, but more importantly, reaching a performance level essential for generative AI to be useful in enterprise workflows.\\n\\nEnterprise AI needs models to be performant on accuracy, latency, customizability, and operating cost. We show that our much smaller MoveLM 7B almost consistently outperforms out-of-the-box LLMs on enterprise tasks for all these dimensions.\\n\\nModel \\n \\n \\n \\n Task Type \\n \\n \\n Best 6B/7B OOTB Model \\n Few-shot \\n \\n \\n MoveLM 7B \\n Zero-shot \\n \\n \\n GPT-3.5 Turbo \\n Zero-shot \\n \\n \\n GPT-3.5 Turbo \\n Few-shot \\n \\n \\n GPT-4 \\n Zero-shot \\n \\n \\n GPT-4 \\n Few-shot \\n \\n \\n \\n Relevance - internal dataset \\n \\n \\n 0.33 \\n \\n \\n 0.93 \\n \\n \\n 0.84 \\n \\n \\n 0.84 \\n \\n \\n 0.92 \\n \\n \\n 0.95 \\n \\n \\n \\n Extraction - structured output for queries \\n \\n \\n 0.38 \\n \\n \\n 0.98 \\n \\n \\n 0.22 \\n \\n \\n 0.72 \\n \\n \\n 0.38 \\n \\n \\n 0.73 \\n \\n \\n \\n Reasoning - custom triggering \\n \\n \\n 0.62 \\n \\n \\n 0.93 \\n \\n \\n 0.87 \\n \\n \\n 0.88 \\n \\n \\n 0.9 \\n \\n \\n 0.88 \\n \\n \\n \\n Classification - domain of user query \\n \\n \\n 0.21 \\n \\n \\n 0.79 \\n \\n \\n 0.6 \\n \\n \\n 0.73 \\n \\n \\n 0.7 \\n \\n \\n 0.76 \\n \\n \\n \\n Extraction - structured output from entity typing \\n \\n \\n 0.83 \\n \\n \\n 0.87 \\n \\n \\n 0.9 \\n \\n \\n 0.89 \\n \\n \\n 0.89 \\n \\n \\n 0.89 \\n \\n \\n \\n Classification - intent for analytics \\n \\n \\n 0.22 \\n \\n \\n 0.87 \\n \\n \\n 0.58 \\n \\n \\n 0.58 \\n \\n \\n 0.55 \\n \\n \\n 0.64 \\n \\n \\n \\n Relevance - forms \\n \\n \\n 0.61 \\n \\n \\n 0.95 \\n \\n \\n 0.65 \\n \\n \\n 0.73 \\n \\n \\n 0.64 \\n \\n \\n 0.89 \\n \\n \\n \\n Classification - intent for conversation \\n \\n \\n 0.12 \\n \\n \\n 0.72 \\n \\n \\n 0.68 \\n \\n \\n 0.69 \\n \\n \\n 0.7 \\n \\n \\n 0.72 \\n \\n \\n \\n Classification - people look-up \\n \\n \\n 0.78 \\n \\n \\n 0.99 \\n \\n \\n 0.54 \\n \\n \\n 0.61 \\n \\n \\n 0.9 \\n \\n \\n 0.93 \\n \\n \\n \\n Extraction - structured output for slot filling \\n (F1 Score) \\n \\n \\n 0.18 \\n \\n \\n 0.77 \\n \\n \\n 0.13 \\n \\n \\n 0.44 \\n \\n \\n 0.15 \\n \\n \\n 0.50 \\n \\n \\n \\n Classification - ticket closing comments helpfulness \\n \\n \\n 0.52 \\n \\n \\n 0.9 \\n \\n \\n 0.45 \\n \\n \\n 0.64 \\n \\n \\n 0.67 \\n \\n \\n 0.73\\n\\nAll metrics are variants of exact-match accuracy unless mentioned otherwise.

Time, place, our environment — these are all important signals we use to interpret the true meaning behind language. Furthermore, words and sentences are often inherently ambiguous, which is why we use conversation to more fully understand each other.\\n\\nThis is why it is incredibly hard for machines to understand natural language. Language is complex, nuanced and can shift its meaning in different contexts. In short, language is:\\n\\nInherently ambiguous\\n\\nVast, versatile, and colloquial\\n\\nDynamic\\n\\nContextual\\n\\nBetter understood with conversation context\\n\\nLanguage is ambiguous\\n\\nPeople are great at describing what they see, but not so good at saying things in a way that will help the listener understand quickly. In the IT ticketing world we focus on, we see this happen when employees file tickets that usually describe symptoms and only rarely describe the underlying issue in the way an IT specialist would phrase it.\\n\\nThe way someone describes an issue rarely matches the title of the corresponding article\\n\\nAs mentioned in the last blog, a good service desk agent draws on experience to grasp what the employee is talking about, but for a natural language understanding (NLU) system, this isn't so easy. Scripted rules are impractical. It would take hundreds of rules, for example, to match all the ways people ask to add a colleague to a list. An NLU system needs to operate more like a service desk agent, by ignoring irrelevant words (what we call “noise”), recognizing what entities the person is talking about, and identifying the person’s intent.\\n\\nNot every word in a request is important; NLU systems must detect the words that matter\\n\\nLanguage is vast, versatile, and colloquial\\n\\nLanguage is vast, and you’re only scratching the surface by counting the 600,000 entries in the Oxford English Dictionary. Words can be assembled in many different ways, making it hard to predict which combination of words a person will put together to describe an issue.\\n\\nKeyword-based search struggles with the different meanings words take on, in context\\n\\nNow consider an NLU system that tries to find the meanings of words quickly. A hard-coded approach is slow, since it needs to test each word it reads against a list of words, looking for a match. A faster approach is to look for common patterns in what people say, and learn which words are likely to appear where in the pattern. IT requests have common patterns that can be understood with machine learning models that take sentence semantics into account. When we know the pattern, we know which word is likely to be someone’s name, and which is likely to be the name of a software package — even without looking up a dictionary.\\n\\nLanguage is dynamic\\n\\nAn NLU system is more powerful in a focused setting like IT, where it can focus on the language patterns employees use there. But there’s a downside to machine learning in enterprise IT environments: not enough data. Machine learning requires huge amounts of data to deliver precise results. To learn, an enterprise NLU system needs creative approaches to finding enough data — or augmenting the data it has.\\n\\nLanguage is contextual\\n\\nNo one likes to waste their time explaining — or listening to — every little detail, so language is built to convey ideas in a few words. We do this by being aware of context. When a colleague approaches me with a question, I count on my memory and senses for context: Who is she? What topics have we discussed recently? What’s her team working on now?\\n\\nA good NLU system uses context to clarify ambiguous questions and statements\\n\\nAs people trained on years of having conversations, we draw on our senses and memory to get context effortlessly. When we try to create an NLU system to do this, we see it’s not effortless. Contextual cues that a person would pick up are not available to the NLU, unless we build a way to supply information like time, identity, and location.\\n\\nLanguage is conversational\\n\\nIt turns out, basic conversational ability is hard to build in an NLU system. Think about our expectations when we chat with a friend. We’re thrown off if a reply strays from the thread, we hate to repeat what we’ve said, and we want just enough information in each reply. Too much, and we feel man-splained; too little, and we feel ignored.\\n\\nTo build an NLU system that gives people a natural flow of conversation, we need a probabilistic approach. When talking with a friend, you’re never 100% certain what sort of response your friend is waiting for, so you choose the words you think are most likely to get your point across, right now. Machine learning-based systems are well suited to probabilistic problems like this. If a machine learning model has been trained on enough relevant data, it can accurately predict the right response in a situation.\\n\\nIn an upcoming post, we’ll dive into useful techniques that can address this and the other hard problems that stand in the way of building a good NLU system.\\n\\nnlu\\n\\nlanguage\\n\\nchatbot\\n\\ncontext\\n\\nconversational\\n\\ntechnology\\n\\nMore blog posts\\n\\nHow to unlock continual service improvement with AIOps\\n      \\n        \\n          Discover how AIOps transforms IT operations from reactive to proactive.

The industry declared them dead, citing their inability to deliver significant value to businesses. Skepticism was at an all-time high, and many wondered if conversational AI was just a passing fad.\\n\\nHowever, fast forward a few years, and it's clear that chatbots are not only alive and well but thriving. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), the potential for conversational AI in enterprise applications has grown exponentially.\\n\\nWhat changed to bring conversational AI back to life and make it such a critical component of the future of business?\\n\\nThat's the question I answered in my recent webinar hosted by Microsoft on ChatGPT and LLMs in the enterprise. I explored the evolution of these technologies and the transformative impact they're having on businesses today. From chatbots to virtual assistants, I delved into the potential of this tech to revolutionize enterprise applications and open up a world of new opportunities.\\n\\nDuring the webinar, I shared stories from our customers — including Hearst, Equinix, loanDepot, and Consumers Energy — who have already begun to see the impact of conversational AI in their daily operations. We explored how LLMs like GPT-3, the model that powers ChatGPT, are being used to uplevel and modernize the employee experience, allowing teams across departments to focus on more strategic work.\\n\\nIf you're curious about the future of conversational AI and how it can transform your business, I encourage you to watch the full webinar.\\n\\n👉 Watch my webinar with Microsoft now.\\n\\nContact  Moveworks to learn how AI can supercharge your workforce's productivity.\\n\\nnews\\n\\nMore blog posts\\n\\nHow to unlock continual service improvement with AIOps\\n      \\n        \\n          Discover how AIOps transforms IT operations from reactive to proactive.

But while these tools should make life easier, learning to use so many applications — each with their own array of buttons, menus, and submenus — often has the opposite effect. The fundamental problem here is this language barrier between us and our technology: people communicate with conversation, not by clicking buttons and navigating through menus.\\n\\nLast week, in Part 1, we analyzed attempts to overcome this language barrier with chatbots that engage users in scripted interactions. Across the board, these chatbots are unsuccessful because they don’t address the ambiguity and unpredictability of real-world conversations, which cannot be scripted out in advance. Ultimately, engaging users on their terms requires a new approach to both understanding natural language and managing conversation flow.\\n\\nIn this blog, we’ll explore how that new approach is streamlining human-computer interaction in two distinct ways:\\n\\nFirst, advances in natural language understanding (NLU) allow the latest chatbots to deeply grasp language by considering context\\n\\nSecond, probabilistic conversational AI enables such chatbots to determine the ideal response on the fly, rather than sticking to a fixed script\\n\\nFigure 1: Overcoming the language barrier between humans and computers requires probabilistic chatbots,\\n\\nwhich engage users in natural conversation.\\n\\nConversation requires context\\n\\nAll of us have had bad experiences with chatbots. The question is, what does it take to build a good experience? Not surprisingly, if you want a chatbot that works, it needs a strong enough understanding of language to be conversational.\\n\\n“Understand” is the key term here. Conventional chatbots rely on basic natural language processing (NLP), which entails analyzing the literal words in a given sentence. But simply processing words at a surface level is quite different from understanding the user’s intentions. That’s where NLU comes into play — not only parsing the words said, but also evaluating those words with the context that defines conversation.\\n\\nSo what is context? Context is shared, unspoken assumptions. It is all the external knowledge that people, unlike machines, naturally bring to conversation, and includes everything from current events to previous interactions to the location of the speaker. Simply put, conversation depends on context, and conventional chatbots fail precisely because they consider each sentence in a vacuum — as if it fell from the sky.\\n\\nOf course, it’s still impossible to program a computer with the lifetime of context that each of us brings to our conversations. What we can do is approximate that intuition by using machine learning to decipher four types of context:\\n\\nSyntactic Context: By understanding the structure of a sentence, we can separate the signal of that sentence — its actionable information — from the noise.\\n\\nUser Context: By considering key information about the user, such as their job title and their location, we can clarify requests that would otherwise be ambiguous.\\n\\nDomain Context: By taking into account terminology specific to the user’s organization and domain, we can surface information that is uniquely relevant to them.\\n\\nHistorical Context: By acknowledging past conversations, we can accumulate knowledge throughout the bot exchange to understand the user’s underlying intent.\\n\\nWhat’s clear from all of this is that a system capable of conversation must consider quite a lot of outside context: who is talking, how they phrase their requests, the circumstances of the conversation, and what they said a minute ago. After four years of working to solve this problem, we found that conversation without context is impossible.\\n\\nThe following four examples demonstrate how each kind of context plays a key role in conversation:\\n\\nSyntactic Context\\n\\nFigure 2: Understanding syntax allows chatbots to disambiguate similar user utterances,\\n\\nseparating important signals from distracting noise.\\n\\nOne of the fundamental challenges of understanding language is that the same words often have different meanings, depending on the syntax of the sentence. And determining the relevant meaning is the only way to decide which information in that sentence is actionable signal and which is irrelevant noise. This deep, syntactic knowledge takes a layer cake of machine learning techniques, from semantic frame parsing to entity inference to statistical grammar models.\\n\\nIn Figure 2, both requests for IT support use the words “marketing” and “Brad Smith.” But in the first case, these words are completely irrelevant to the task, while in the second case, all of those words convey the key message of the sentence. The ability to disambiguate different intentions from the same words is a major step toward natural conversation.\\n\\nUser Context\\n\\nFigure 3: By taking into account the user, bots can deliver information specific to\\n\\nthat individual user’s needs, based on their role, location, or department.\\n\\nBut understanding what a user wants takes more than just looking at syntax. Take a look at Figure 3. There are two very similar requests, both about accessing a regional dashboard. Before taking into account the users’ roles and departments, these requests appear identical. However, for Akbar, a sales director, our machine learning models tell us probabilistically that he needs access to Salesforce to view the relevant dashboard; whereas Paula, an analyst, needs access to Tableau, where her organization’s financial data lives.\\n\\nThe difference between Akbar and Paula is a perfect illustration of the difference between NLP and NLU. Rather than offering both employees the same response, an advanced NLU chatbot factors in their roles and departments to surface the right software. This knowledge of user context allows the bot to distinguish between many different dashboard options — with the same kind of intuition that a service desk agent would bring to the table.\\n\\nDomain Context\\n\\nFigure 4: Domain context allows chatbots to deliver responses that are specific to a particular organization.\\n\\nAlready, by factoring in syntactic and user context, we’ve gone a long way toward demystifying the complexity of language, but there is another critical component of conversation left out of this picture.\\n\\nConsider the question, “Where is John Lennon?” A search engine like Google answers this question with generic information about the Beatles’ lead singer. However, at Moveworks, we have customers who name their conference rooms after famous musicians, and other customers for whom John Lennon is an employee’s name.\\n\\nTo make conversational AI successful, we needed models built to understand that words take on different meanings in these different domains. Interpreting these ambiguities requires rich, contextual background for individual companies, enabling our bot to provide a conference room map in one case and employee contact information in the other.\\n\\nHistorical Context\\n\\nFigure 5:\\n\\nAwareness of past conversational back-and-forth helps chatbots disambiguate user requests\\n\\nand respond with relevant information.\\n\\nHistorical context allows a bot to respond differently to the same utterance, depending on past conversations. While simple at first glance, “This issue has been fixed” can actually be quite a complex statement.\\n\\nIn Figure 5, both users said the same thing. In this first exchange, Ankoor has chatted previously with the bot. But in the second conversation, Maria’s statement comes out of nowhere. Since the bot doesn’t have enough context to answer Maria, it asks a follow up question to disambiguate.\\n\\nWhen talking to our coworkers, we can immediately jump into complex conversations, because we have a shared past that informs the present narrative. Without even realizing it, we reference this entire history of interaction when responding to even simple requests.\\n\\nAs people, we are very good at consuming lots of context and allowing our experience and intuition to determine what is and isn’t important. For conventional chatbots, on the other hand, a lack of contextual knowledge makes it a challenge for them to follow real conversations. To build a chatbot that can keep up, you need to tackle NLU first by building models that understand context. Only then, can you work the second piece of the puzzle — delivering the right response.\\n\\nBidding for the right to respond\\n\\nEvery day, we benefit from probabilistic “bidding systems” without realizing it. For example, Google results vary depending on what is asked for. Sometimes, the search engine responds with a list of links, or a summary of a Wikipedia article, or a selection of videos, or a combination of all these results.\\n\\nIn a dynamic IT environment, providing relevant answers has an additional layer of complexity. Agents are always creating new knowledge base articles, adding new conference rooms, and deploying new tools to keep up with internal demands. Because there are so many changes and because these changes are so disparate, trying to hardwire the right answer into a chatbot creates brittle interactions that require constant maintenance to be of any help to employees. And that’s why a probabilistic approach that customizes answers to the user asking is so important. A bidding system based on machine learning models looks continuously at available actions and lets the models decide what is most relevant to the user.\\n\\nAn added challenge is that a conversation doesn’t look like a list of search results. A chatbot only gets one shot to provide a relevant and actionable answer; it can’t just throw 30 links on to the screen for a user to scroll through and hope one of them is relevant. A bidding system is able to deliver a single relevant answer. Sometimes the right response is to redirect the conversation to an IT agent; sometimes it means surfacing resources like a knowledge base article. Crafting a helpful response is not trivial and making the response easily understandable is an even greater challenge.\\n\\nFigure 6: Making decisions based on models — not hardcoded rules — allows chatbots\\n\\nto adjust to changing context in real time.\\n\\nSo let’s take a look at a common scenario for the Moveworks chatbot: a user asks for software access, in this case Adobe Acrobat Pro. The bot first evaluates critical context, such as the user’s job, department, and past support tickets. Then, it selects the best response by holding an auction where different possible resolution methods compete to demonstrate the highest value to the user.\\n\\nThere are many possible solutions to this question. The bot could surface a form, submit a new ticket, or provision software — just to name a few. Any of these actions would make sense, but the bot knows that instantly provisioning Adobe Acrobat Pro is the best response by understanding all the context of the original question. The user gets their software in seconds, and the bot stows away this information for future engagements with not only this user, but also with other users in this organization.\\n\\nThis leads us to another inherent benefit of machine learning — a chatbot learns from its past conversations. Recording employee feedback allows the bidding system to improve over time for the whole organization. Without a probabilistic system, a chatbot couldn’t learn from these real-life interactions and would continue to provide the same answer, right or wrong.\\n\\nFigure 7: Different solutions bid for the opportunity to solve an IT issue. When one or multiple options reach the confidence threshold, a response is sent to the user in seconds.\\n\\nThe conversational interface\\n\\nMost user interfaces — from the graphical user interface (GUI) to conventional chatbots — share a flawed approach: trying to anticipate what users want. For GUIs, this approach takes the form of buttons and menus, while for conventional chatbots, it means scripting out fixed dialogs. Fundamentally, attempting to predict what a user needs is a dead end. People communicate with conversation, and conversation is unpredictable.\\n\\nAt Moveworks, we decided to go back to the drawing board. For one, we saw that addressing the contextual nature of communication requires more than simple natural language processing; it takes deep natural language understanding. And for another, we learned that seamless conversation depends on probability-based decisions, which determine the right response to a user’s request on the fly rather than in advance. This combination of advanced NLU and probabilistic machine learning makes the power of modern computing accessible to all people, regardless of their technical know-how.\\n\\nTurns out, it’s simple to build a chatbot that’s complicated, but profoundly complicated to build one simple enough for everyone to use. That’s why Moveworks has spent the last four years creating and operationalizing hundreds of machine learning models — to completely eliminate the language barrier between us and our machines. Because beyond just our IT support chatbot, we’re building toward a future that’s truly conversational.\\n\\nContact  Moveworks to learn how AI can supercharge your workforce productivity.\\n\\ntechnology\\n\\nMore blog posts\\n\\nHow to unlock continual service improvement with AIOps\\n      \\n        \\n          Discover how AIOps transforms IT operations from reactive to proactive.

New investors ICONIQ Capital,\\n\\nKleiner Perkins and Sapphire Ventures led the round with participation from existing investors Lightspeed Venture Partners, Bain Capital Ventures, and Comerica Bank. The round also included a personal investment from\\n\\nJohn W. Thompson, Partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners and Chairman of Microsoft.\\n\\nThe new capital will be used to accelerate product innovation for Moveworks\\' Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and advanced Conversational-AI technology to meet global demand for the platform for new and existing customers.\\n\\n\"Moveworks has become the clear market leader in IT support automation, yet in many ways the company is still in its first inning,\" said Mamoon Hamid, partner, Kleiner Perkins. \"I\\'ve been tracking Moveworks from the moment they signed their first customer and we believe it has the potential to become the main interaction model for a broader set of enterprise workflows. We\\'re thrilled to partner with the Moveworks team — IT support is just the start.\"\\n\\nLeading CIOs from some of the most recognizable enterprises in the world — including Broadcom,Medallia, Autodesk and Nutanix — already resolve 30-40 percent of their daily IT support issues autonomously with Moveworks\\' advanced machine learning, conversational-AI and Natural Language Understanding platform.\\n\\nThe round of financing comes on the heels of significant momentum. Since coming out of stealth six months ago, Moveworks has added a number of new customers including Align Technology, LinkedIn, Symantec, Belkin, Stitch Fix, AppDynamics and more. The company has also achieved 300 percent year-to-year revenue growth.\\n\\n\"Building Moveworks over the past three years has been an exercise in discipline and focus,\" said Bhavin Shah, CEO, Moveworks. \"The possibilities of AI are so vast that many start-ups get trapped by the allure of solving every problem their customers present to them. We chose to focus on a single problem that\\'s been holding IT support back for the last 30 years: resolving IT tickets, quickly and with minimal disruption to employees\\' day-to-day jobs. We focused AI on deeply understanding enterprise IT support tickets to solve this very difficult problem. And we\\'ve succeeded.\"\\n\\nShah adds, \"Instead of making machine learning our customers\\' problem, we made it our job. Our system gets better with every passing day and with every new customer that comes on board. The Moveworks engineering and product teams are not only some of the best in AI, but they have also accomplished what most companies today talk about but aren\\'t actually doing. We\\'ve operationalized the modeling, training, annotation, re-training, re-factoring, algorithmic designs, and continuous deployments to ensure our systems learn and get better in real time. Very few AI companies in the Valley can do what we\\'re doing, and we plan to use this capital to evolve and amplify the impact of our platform.\"\\n\\n\"I haven\\'t been this excited about a product, team and opportunity in a long time,\" said Aditya Agrawal, Partner, ICONIQ Capital. \"Moveworks is not just transforming IT operations, they are building a more modern and enlightened way to work. They\\'ve built a platform that simplifies and streamlines every interaction between employees and IT, enabling both to focus on what matters. I have been lucky to have had the chance to work alongside great teams to help build Facebook, Dropbox and Flipkart in a direct capacity. I am honored to have the chance to do the same with Bhavin, Vaibhav, Varun, Jiang and the rest of the Moveworks team.\"\\n\\n\"We invest in what we believe will be companies of consequence: companies that are addressing a large market opportunity with impactful technology and world-class teams\\xa0 — Moveworks has all of these elements and more,\" said Rajeev Dham, Managing Director, Sapphire Ventures. \"They have taken a problem space that has existed for 30 years and solved it using advanced AI. The potential for Moveworks is huge, but the excitement we heard from our CIO network and Moveworks\\' customers stems from what they are already delivering. I\\'m looking forward to being a part of the next phase of their growth.\"\\n\\nMedia Contact\\n\\nSophia Xepoleas, Sr PR Manager\\n\\nEmail:\\n\\npr@moveworks.ai\\n\\nWeb:\\n\\nMoveworks.com/contact\\n\\nSolutions\\n\\nCustomers\\n\\nResources\\n\\nBlog\\n\\nSitemap\\n\\nPlatform\\n\\nPlatform overview\\n\\nMoveworks API\\n\\nSystem status\\n\\nCompany\\n\\nAbout us\\n\\nNewsroom\\n\\nContact us\\n\\nCareers\\n\\n©2023 Moveworks, Inc.\\n\\nPrivacy policies', metadata={'source': 'https://www.moveworks.com/press-releases/2019/11/moveworks-announces-75m-round-led-by-kleiner-perkins-iconiq-capital-and-sapphire-ventures'}),\n",

Already deployed and endorsed by CIOs at Fortune 500 and leading enterprise companies such as Autodesk, Broadcom, and Nutanix, Moveworks combines Natural Language Understanding (NLU), advanced conversational-AI, and process automation to identify the optimal solution and fully resolve IT issues, instantly and autonomously.\\n\\nWith Moveworks, companies can completely eliminate the need for IT staff to work on tasks such as provisioning applications, resetting passwords, unlocking accounts, managing email lists, and answering questions so they can focus on high-value activities.\\n\\n\"Technology is the backbone of business productivity, yet, the average IT support ticket takes three entire days to resolve,\" said Bhavin Shah, CEO and co-founder, Moveworks. \"IT teams waste valuable time and money resolving the same issues over and over again. But it\\'s a hard business problem to solve and all of the approaches up to now have involved a lot of manual work supported by heavy processes and workflow tools. That\\'s why we built Moveworks: to provide the enterprise with an instant and autonomous solution that doesn\\'t just log the issue, but does the work.\"\\n\\n\"We decided to approach the problem from a new angle. We developed our own NLU system that\\'s pre-trained to understand IT support issues,\" continues Shah. \"Once the system correctly deciphers the issue, it can decide the best course of action to take. And we\\'ve built numerous integrations into common enterprise tools so we can then go and complete the task or retrieve the right piece of information. We designed the system to learn continuously from every interaction at every customer. So we have this kind of network effect where the more customers we bring on, and the more employees we serve, the smarter the system gets for everyone.\"\\n\\nShah concludes, \"We believe that software should be graded not by how many features it has, or how many workflows you can build, but by how much real work it\\'s doing, such as completing tasks or resolving issues. This is where strong forms of AI really start to change the game, not just making suggestions but actually doing the work.\"\\n\\nBuilt by machine learning experts from Google and Facebook, Moveworks concludes that up to 75 percent of enterprise IT support issues can be understood and resolved using AI. The company is on its way to hitting that number, with many customers already seeing 25 percent to 35 percent of their daily IT tickets resolved autonomously by Moveworks.\\n\\nAccording to the CIOs of companies using Moveworks, the efficiency and agility gains are significant.\\n\\nWendy M. Pfeiffer, CIO of Nutanix\\n\\n\"We got to a point where our employee base was growing at a pace that resulted in a 40 percent spike in IT requests. We tried portals, apps, workflows, and traditional automation, but it wasn\\'t working. Then we found Moveworks and it\\'s been nothing short of magic. Most days, more than 30 percent of our IT issues are resolved autonomously, reducing the workload on our service desk and giving us more time and resources to focus on other critical business areas.\"\\n\\nAndy Nallappan, CIO of Broadcom\\n\\n\"As a global company with over 15,000 people worldwide, including many contractors, the ability to resolve IT issues quickly becomes critical to the business. Nothing came close to a truly autonomous solution until Moveworks. We didn\\'t have to teach it anything, or write dialog flows, or create scripts — it was ready to go out-of-the-box and learned the nuances of our environment all by itself. Within the first few weeks, we were experiencing 20 percent resolution rates, and that\\'s climbing. We couldn\\'t do business without Moveworks today. \"\\n\\nPrakash Kota, CIO of Autodesk\\n\\n\"As a CIO, I have to focus on making IT operations more efficient. At the same time, I have to create an amazing employee experience that is intuitive and frictionless, which helps us attract and retain the best talent in the industry. Moveworks enables us to do both simultaneously, and provides modern AI capabilities for our workforce. Moveworks makes it simple to integrate real AI seamlessly with our existing platform.\"\\n\\nShah credits the success of Moveworks to the company\\'s focus on resolution, as opposed to more traditional metrics like monthly active users. \"It\\'s not enough for people to just use the tool, we have to be doing real, valuable work for them. That\\'s how we measure success,\" adds Shah.\\n\\nMoveworks relies on cutting-edge technology to make the solution easy to use. \"We had to completely rethink conversational-AI,\" says Shah. \"Most chatbots are really bad because they rely on pre-scripted flows and, if you go off-script, they just get confused. So we created a stateless conversation engine that performs deep NLU at every step of a conversation. The system knows if users are trying to switch topics, or if they misread an instruction, or are responding out of turn to an earlier question. It\\'s an incredibly fluid experience that keeps users engaged as we guide them to a resolution.\"\\n\\nFueling Moveworks\\' progress and success to date is a $30 million Series A funding from leading venture capital firms Bain Capital Ventures and Lightspeed Venture Partners.\\n\\n\"The market is full of companies claiming AI capabilities, but most are just using generic machine learning models to make predictions or classify data,\" said Enrique Salem, partner at Bain Capital Ventures and former CEO of Symantec. \"When I first met Bhavin and his co-founders, I immediately knew they were poised to do something big. The Moveworks team is at the forefront of so many different aspects of machine learning, and they have pulled it all together into this incredibly elegant solution that does real work, resolves real issues, and delivers demonstrable value to their customers. We\\'re thrilled to be partnering with such a world-class team and look forward to playing a part in the company\\'s growth and success.\"\\n\\n\"Moveworks is one of only a few true AI companies in the enterprise software market,\" said Arif Janmohamed, Partner, Lightspeed Venture Partners. \"While other companies have been investing in incrementally better user interfaces, or basic applications of Machine Learning, Moveworks has been building an AI system that gets smarter over time and has achieved what no other company in the space has: true autonomy. We\\'re excited to have partnered with Moveworks from Day One and look forward to an exciting journey ahead.\"\\n\\nAbout Moveworks\\n\\nMoveworks is the industry\\'s first autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) platform for resolving IT issues in the enterprise.

With this major expansion, Moveworks resolves employees\\' requests no matter what they need, from IT support to HR answers to policy information.\\n\\nAs of this release, employees can describe all support requests to the Moveworks bot, available in business collaboration tools like Microsoft Teams and Slack. The Moveworks Intelligence Engine™ uses natural language understanding (NLU) to interpret each issue—then provides the right resolution by integrating with other enterprise software. Already, companies such as Palo Alto Networks, AppDynamics, and Nutanix are automating support across multiple departments with the Moveworks Employee Service Platform™.\\n\\n\"Everything we do at Moveworks is inspired by a simple idea: it shouldn\\'t take days to get help at work,\" said CEO Bhavin Shah. \"But to make that idea a reality, we\\'ve had to build one of the most complex machine learning systems in the history of the enterprise. Today, after half a decade, Moveworks is the first AI platform that delivers instant help to all lines of business.\"\\n\\nFounded in 2016, Moveworks has specialized in resolving IT support issues, handling more than 40 percent\\xa0of IT issues without any manual intervention for many customers. Yet other lines of business, including HR and Finance, face the same fundamental challenge as the IT department: an endless barrage of requests from employees that sideline higher priorities. Moveworks has therefore expanded to these additional departments, enabled by machine learning breakthroughs in understanding language.\\n\\n\"It\\'s really the small moments that create your company culture,\" said Elizabeth Wheeler, Senior Manager of Benefits & HR Connect at Palo Alto Networks. \"With Moveworks, we\\'ve made those millions of small moments effortless—by giving our employees what they need, when they need it. The result is that my team can focus on the big projects that move our business forward.\"\\n\\nA Single Platform for Employee Service\\n\\nA \"one-stop shop\" for every kind of support issue, the Employee Service Platform is the most significant product release in the history of Moveworks.\\n\\nThe platform retains Moveworks\\' core IT use cases, including unlocking accounts, provisioning software, ordering devices, editing email groups, troubleshooting errors, and more. And now, it also contains Moveworks\\' new modules for HR, Finance, Facilities, and Employee Communications. Between surfacing relevant forms, pulling answers from disparate knowledge bases, and routing complex requests to the right subject-matter expert, the platform resolves issues concerning all lines of business.\\n\\n\"Our goal with Moveworks was to make the entry point for support a natural conversation,\" said Saran Mandair, Vice President of Global IT at DocuSign. \"The results have been extremely positive. Our employees are now going to the Moveworks bot to get help in real time.\"\\n\\nThe most common type of employee service issue is an information-seeking question. Under the hood, the Intelligence Engine combines domain recognition, semantic search, and deep integrations to address such questions with answers from every department\\'s knowledge base. Employees no longer need to comb through multiple knowledge bases themselves, since Moveworks searches the entire enterprise for answers in seconds.\\n\\n\"As a fast-growing company, we need to add new employees, without increasing our operating costs at the same pace,\" said Ravindra Sunku, Senior Director of IT at Stitch Fix. \"Moveworks\\' AI platform has allowed us to keep our support costs stable, even as we doubled in size to more than 10,000 employees worldwide.\"\\n\\nMoveworks goes beyond linking to enterprise resources like articles and forms. Instead, the Intelligence Engine transforms these resources to display only the important information, in a conversational format, directly inside the collaboration tool. Users can, for instance, fill out an IT form without leaving the Moveworks interface in Microsoft Teams, or receive just the pertinent paragraph of an HR policy after asking Moveworks a question in Slack.\\n\\nAccording to Forrester, a leading research and advisory company: \"Firms have many systems of record for functional domains such as HR and facilities but struggle to provide timely access to these domains\\' services. Too often, the default for fielding requests for services is still \\'send an email to a shared inbox\\' ... Employees expect fast, consumer-grade access to the services and information they need to get their jobs done.\"1\\n\\nInteractive Employee Communications\\n\\nAs part of the expanded platform, Moveworks also released a new Employee Communications module, which enables company leaders to send personalized, actionable, and interactive messages via the Moveworks bot.\\n\\nTo revolutionize employee service, resolving support issues is only half the battle. The other half requires preventing issues, before they arise, with effective communication. From policy changes to system outages to software migrations, messages sent through Moveworks achieve dramatically higher engagement than mass emails, since they replace such emails with two-way conversations. The Intelligence Engine ingests each customer\\'s knowledge articles and documents several times per day, enabling the Moveworks bot to answer follow-up questions about these messages automatically.\\n\\n\"Most company comms today are sent in emails,\" said Amith Nair, CIO at Vituity. \"Guess what: no one reads emails! That\\'s why we\\'re shifting most of our comms strategy to using Moveworks over chat. It\\'s about making sure our messages go to the right people on the right platform, so they actually get read.\"\\n\\nThe Moveworks Intelligence Engine\\n\\nPowering the platform is the Moveworks Intelligence Engine, which received a comprehensive update to handle the diversity of HR, Finance, and Facilities issues. Unlike other platforms, Moveworks does not compel customers to fine-tune machine learning models, script out conversations, or program fixed workflows on their own. Rather, the Intelligence Engine automates employee service end-to-end, from the initial request to the final resolution.\\n\\nAll five components of the Intelligence Engine are now purpose-built to address any support issue. When an employee engages with Moveworks, Language Core™ understands the issues using advanced NLU, while Dynamic Flow™ handles the unpredictable conversation by generating responses in real time. Action Bid™ then chooses the best way to resolve the issue with probabilistic machine learning, triggering Semantic Match™ to find the most relevant resource inside the Enterprise Cache™, which contains all resources across the enterprise in a format optimized for chat. Together, they allow Moveworks to deliver instant help across all lines of business.\\n\\n\"The Moveworks Intelligence Engine relies on machine learning techniques that didn\\'t exist just twelve months ago,\" said CTO Vaibhav Nivargi. \"By creating extremely precise models for understanding enterprise language, we\\'ve solved a critical business challenge—while making the user experience effortless.\"\\n\\nMedia Contact\\n\\nSophia Xepoleas, Sr PR Manager\\n\\nEmail:\\n\\npr@moveworks.ai\\n\\nWeb:\\n\\nMoveworks.com/contact\\n\\nSolutions\\n\\nCustomers\\n\\nResources\\n\\nBlog\\n\\nSitemap\\n\\nPlatform\\n\\nPlatform overview\\n\\nMoveworks API\\n\\nSystem status\\n\\nCompany\\n\\nAbout us\\n\\nNewsroom\\n\\nContact us\\n\\nCareers\\n\\n©2023 Moveworks, Inc.\\n\\nPrivacy policies', metadata={'source': 'https://www.moveworks.com/press-releases/2021/03/instant-help-at-work-moveworks-announces-next-evolution-with-ai-powered-employee-service-platform'}),\n",

If you ask Google “How much muscle can you gain in a week?”, Google not only finds the relevant web page, but also extracts the exact answer in a short paragraph from that web page.\\n\\nThis “featured snippet” style of answer is so useful that Google displays it above all other search results.\\n\\nFigure 1: Fully-phrased questions make up a growing portion of searches\\n\\nJiang Chen, one of Moveworks’ co-founders, and I usually refer to these snippets as WebAnswers, which was the project name originally used by Google. We know this style of answer well because we were both founding members of that project at Google. We built that service from the ground up and saw it grow to significantly influence the Google search experience. When we started this project, less than one percent of Google search queries were entered as fully-phrased questions, like the one shown in the example above. Searchers were more accustomed to entering clusters of keywords. But after introducing WebAnswers, we saw a steady shift in the phrasing of search queries as people switched to posing more long-form questions, and relying less on keywords. In fact, featured snippets are now provided for about 12% of Google search traffic. This proved to be one of the first and most successful applications of natural language understanding (NLU) in consumer search technology.\\n\\nConsumer search hasn’t always been a great experience, but in the last two decades, it’s come a long way. Now you can type a question, and get an answer. Simple. But what about enterprise search? Unfortunately, that’s still broken.\\n\\nFigure 2: In the enterprise, most search tools remain primitive\\n\\nFor example, if you search an enterprise knowledge base for “How do I setup my Java environment,” you’ll struggle to find the relevant article, and you’ll often get seemingly random results, such as email interruption notices or advice on finding your MAC address.\\n\\nSo, why is enterprise search still broken? Well, the enterprise setting presents challenges that make search a very hard problem!\\n\\nConsumer search engines like Google have access to at least 12 billion pages on the Internet. Almost every answer repeats itself, in one form or another, on multiple pages across the web. These similar pages reinforce the search result relevance.\\n\\nOn the other hand, a typical company wiki or knowledge base might contain only 50 to 5,000 pages. Usually the answer appears only once — as a paragraph, a sentence, or even a phrase. So the task of enterprise search is vastly different from consumer search. For enterprise search, it’s like trying to find the only needle in a haystack.\\n\\nFigure 3: In the enterprise, there is less data to mine\\n\\nAnother advantage consumer search engines have is the wealth of user interactions. Billions of users scroll and click search results, and this activity provides vital signals that help the search engine make relevance judgements.\\n\\nEnterprise search engines, by contrast, usually have sparse usage that cannot function as a reliable input for article relevance.\\n\\nExisting approaches are primitive, and employees don’t get useful answers\\n\\nAlthough enterprise search is a hard problem, many enterprise search systems still rely on primitive models in an attempt to find relevant knowledge articles. Of these primitive models, keyword tagging is the most common. This involves the author of an article or wiki page adding keyword meta-tags.\\n\\nBut keyword tagging is incredibly brittle, and requires significant manual effort and judgement. Consider the query “Can someone help issue me a new laptop”. If the knowledge writer had earlier added the keyword tags “help,” “laptop,” and “issue” to the “Help with common laptop issues” article, then that article — and not the one about ordering a laptop — would be wrongly served up as the response to the request.\\n\\nFigure 4: Keyword tagging is brittle\\n\\nKeyword tagging is brittle because it ignores syntax. That is, it considers each word in isolation, without regard to its grammatical role in the sentence or phrase. Consider these three sentences:\\n\\nWhat is the process to order a monitor?\\n\\nI need to monitor the order process.\\n\\nI can’t process a monitor order!\\n\\nIf we rely on keywords without considering syntax, these three sentences become indistinguishable. But the syntax tells us that “monitor” describes an object in the first sentence, an action in the second sentence, and a type of order in the third sentence. Syntax is really important for understanding context.\\n\\nA second reason keyword tagging is brittle is that it ignores semantics. Semantics refers to the meaning of the word, phrase or sentence.\\n\\nFigure 5: Keyword tagging ignores semantics\\n\\nThe two sentences in this example have totally opposite meanings but contain very similar words. Keyword tagging falls apart here because it cannot capture the semantic meaning of the words.\\n\\nMost keyword-based search systems are configured to ignore certain words (often referred to as “stop words”) because those words sometimes carry less meaning. Keyword search also ignores punctuation marks. But stop words and punctuation are useful in understanding the meaning of a word or phrase, so when a keyword search ignores them, it reduces the quality of the results.\\n\\nFor the query “What is Box?”, there is only one keyword; “Box.” By only analyzing the keyword, it’s hard to tell whether the underlying search query is asking for a definition of Box, instructions for using Box, help provisioning Box, or troubleshooting advice. Without this information, we can get hilarious (albeit frustrating) search results.\\n\\nFigure 6: Keyword-based systems can’t distinguish between multiple meanings of a word\\n\\nAnother common trait of enterprise language is that it is often symptomatic in nature. And the vocabulary someone uses to describe the symptom can differ a lot from that used to describe the solution. Again, keyword tagging really struggles here.\\n\\nFigure 7:\\xa0 In the enterprise, employees tend to describe symptoms\\n\\nBetween the question “My laptop monitor turned blue” and the answer “Windows blue screen of death (BSOD) error”, the only overlapping keyword is “blue”, which is pretty generic. So you’re probably not going to find this answer with this search query. You might also notice that the question is phrased more like a statement — this is very common in employee support scenarios where employees often don’t know exactly what they need.\\n\\nHow Moveworks delivers modern enterprise search\\n\\nAt Moveworks, we have invested a lot of time and energy in fixing enterprise search by applying cutting-edge natural language understanding and machine learning techniques. Key to our approach is not just digging up articles, but finding precise answers in the form of single sentences, bulleted lists, or paragraphs buried deep within existing knowledge articles, documents, and FAQs.\\n\\nSo how do we do this?\\n\\nUnderstanding the question\\n\\nTo understand what a user is asking for, we have to treat their questions as complex language, not just as clusters of keywords. We employ many machine learning techniques to analyze syntax, structure, and semantics.\\n\\nFigure 8: Machine learning analyzes syntax, structure, and semantics\\n\\nIn this example, by understanding the syntax, we know the focus word for this question is “how many.” By using dependency parsing, which is a machine learning technique of extracting grammatical structure and defining relationships between words, we know the core topic entity is “Zoom meeting,” and we know the topic needs to be framed in the context of “with two-way video.”\\n\\nUnderstanding question language in this way helps not only to understand the meaning of the question, but also to set our expectations for an answer. In this case, we’re expecting to see an article that:\\n\\naddresses the topic of “Zoom meeting”;\\n\\ncontains numbers to address the “how many” focus word; and\\n\\nmentions “two-way audio.”\\n\\nSynonymous words and phrases\\n\\nWord embedding and sentence embedding are two important machine learning techniques that use deep neural networks to better assess the meaning of a piece of text. Word embedding uses mathematics to plot words on a massively multi-dimensional graph relative to other words on the graph. The location of the words in the graph can be based on any attribute of the word, such as what words tend to precede it in a sentence, or how often it shows up in chat messages. We refer to this as projecting words into a common semantic space. Using this approach, semantically similar words and phrases naturally cluster together. The same approach can be used for sentences, in what we call sentence embedding.\\n\\nFigure 9: Word embedding is a technique for finding relationships between words\\n\\nA key output of embedding models is the ability to identify synonymous words and phrases in order to help a search system cross the infamous lexical gap, which refers to the vast difference in the way that questions are structured, compared with their answers. For example, I might have a question about how many attendees I can invite to a Zoom video conference, but a simple search for \"attendees\" fails to yield an answer because Zoom refers to users as \"participants.\" Through the use of word embedding, our search system knows those two words refer to the same thing.\\n\\nUnderstanding synonymous words and phrases also helps us to figure out alternate queries. If you’ve ever entered something into a search bar, struggled to find an answer, then rewritten your search using different terms and consequently found what you’re looking for, then you’ve experienced the benefit of alternate queries. This is particularly important in enterprise search where, as we’ve discussed, answers are in sparse supply.\\n\\nFigure 10: Alternate queries are other ways to phrase the question\\n\\nTo do this we combine the outputs of word and sentence embeddings with sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) machine learning techniques. These techniques allow us to “encode” a piece of text in one format and then “decode” it in another. It’s a popular technique for language translation where you might “encode” English language text and “decode” it in Spanish. Here we use it to figure out the multitude of different ways a question could be phrased.\\n\\nBy applying this method, we can discover that “My laptop won’t power up” is somewhat synonymous with “My laptop won’t start,” “My Lenovo won’t turn on”, “Computer not starting,” and so on. And with all these additional search terms, our ability to find a relevant answer increases significantly.\\n\\nQuery typing is another machine learning technique that helps an enterprise search system take incoming text and understand what type of question or statement it is, so that the system can better predict which solutions or knowledge articles are most likely to be relevant. Query typing machine learning models are able to interpret a symptomatic statement like, “Excel just crashed again” and recognize that it’s a request for troubleshooting guidance. Or that “VPN setup instructions” is most likely a request for a how-to article.\\n\\nThe trick here is using the syntax and semantics of the question to predict what form the answer should take. This serves as an important input to ranking models to help make more accurate predictions about the relevance of an answer.\\n\\nFigure 11: Query typing identifies what sort of question or statement the employee has typed\\n\\nNone of this is possible in a keyword matching-based search system. To make accurate predictions, machine learning is a necessity.\\n\\nUnderstanding the answer\\n\\nKnowledge articles in the enterprise can be long, and they often aggregate many things under a common topic. For a reader, this makes it difficult to find the most relevant part of an article to address their specific issue or request. Similarly, for a search system, it’s challenging to assess the “meaning” of an entire article when it may contain many independently useful facts.\\n\\nOur approach to solving this problem is to divide and conquer long knowledge articles by dissecting them into snippets, much like Google does with web pages. Snippets can come in many forms — short paragraphs, bulleted lists, images with descriptors, single factoid sentences, and so on — so we developed machine learning models that recognize the content, context, and presentation of information, enabling our algorithms to automatically create the right type of snippet for each answer.\\n\\nFigure 12: Dividing a knowledge base article into answers, or snippets\\n\\nEarlier I discussed using Seq2Seq to discover alternative ways of phrasing a query. We apply the same approach for snippets to generate alternative phrases for answers. And much like query typing, we also use answer typing models to identify what type of question this answer will best address. The goal of all of this is to generate as many different signals and insights about questions and answers as possible, so we can more accurately match them.\\n\\nMatching questions to answers\\n\\nOnce we have a good understanding of both questions and answers, we use machine learning to match them. We use a lot of different machine learning techniques here (too many to discuss in this article) but Seq2Seq is a key contributor again.\\n\\nBy training a neural network with tens of millions of examples of questions and answers focused on a specific domain, like enterprise IT, we can use Seq2Seq to predict questions for which a given snippet could be an appropriate answer, or predict what text we might find in an answer for a given question. Essentially we are asking the model “if this is an answer, what question would it answer?”. You can start to see why a model that made its name in language translation is so useful here — we are translating between questions and answers.\\n\\nFigure 13: Seq2Seq techniques help map questions to answers\\n\\nOne of the amazing aspects of this model is that it\\'s very good at putting words into context. Let’s look at the example shown above:\\n\\nthe question contains the word \"issue\" sandwiched in between \"help\" and \"me a laptop\"\\n\\nthe answer contains the word \"request\" followed by \"a new laptop\"\\n\\nThe Seq2Seq neural network recognizes the relationship between the word “issue” in the context of the question, and the word “request” in the context of an answer. Likewise, it sees that \"replacement\" in the question and \"new\" in the answer are probably referring to the same thing. This is very powerful because neither the words nor the sentences are visibly similar, but the model has discovered the relationship nonetheless.\\n\\nAssembling an enterprise search system\\n\\nSolving enterprise search is not a trivial matter. There are many aspects of enterprise search that make it more complex than consumer search. But machine learning and natural language understanding have finally made it possible to answer ambiguous, symptomatic search queries with precise, accurate snippets of information retrieved from sparse knowledge bases.\\n\\nHere are the key ingredients to the Moveworks semantic search system:\\n\\nKnowledge ingestion: We start by ingesting long-form knowledge articles from available knowledge bases\\n\\nAnswer store: From these, we extract useful snippets and index them in an answer store\\n\\nAnswer model: We then use several machine learning techniques to understand the semantic meaning of the answer, identify what type of answer it is, discover synonymous phrases, and predict what questions might match with it\\n\\nQuery model: We analyze the query to identify focus words, topics, context, synonyms/related words, possible alternative forms of the question, and likely answers.\\n\\nMatching model: This model uses available insights from the query model and the answer model to identify candidate snippets.\\n\\nRelevance model: Considers all of the signals, data, and candidate snippets and identifies the most relevant snippets to be returned as likely answers.\\n\\nOf course, the really hard part in all of this is returning these answers in less than 100 milliseconds via a chatbot. But we’ll save that for another post.\\n\\nFigure 14: Finding answers for questions\\n\\nFinally: Conversational search in the enterprise\\n\\nAs a company focused on solving IT support issues using AI, we spend a lot of time looking at the types of issues raised or questions asked by employees in the enterprise; search does not address everything. We’ve had to build many different techniques to address employee needs like unlocking accounts, provisioning software, creating email groups, and other requests that require end-to-end automation rather than answers. But search is a critical part of the support experience for employees: typically, about 1 in 3 support issues are troubleshooting or information-seeking in nature.\\n\\nDespite the demand, enterprise search has lagged far behind consumer search for too long. It\\'s been hard to use and is prone to embarrassing failures. There are good reasons why we’ve not seen much progress: while a deep trove of usage data helps hone consumer search results, for enterprise search, this usage data is hard to come by, so enterprise search has relied instead on keyword tagging, which is primitive; employees often describe symptoms only, resulting in a big gap between how questions are asked and what text appears in answers; and we typically don’t have good data on usage, interaction, or freshness of knowledge articles.\\n\\nMoveworks has met these challenges by applying NLU and advanced machine learning to tackle enterprise search in a unique way. This has not been easy — we’ve had to embrace and develop many novel techniques to overcome the constraints of the enterprise — but the end result is magical. I look forward to sharing more about our approach, technology, and the impact of our enterprise search capability in future articles.\\n\\nInterested in learning more?\\n\\nTo learn more about why NLU matters for IT, and how it helps deliver enterprise help more quickly and more easily, see our posts:\\n\\nWhy is natural language understanding important for resolving IT support tickets?\\n\\nNatural language is hard: 5 reasons why your chatbot just isn\\'t getting you\\n\\nmachine learning\\n\\nnlu\\n\\nlanguage\\n\\nsearch\\n\\nproduct features\\n\\nMore blog posts\\n\\nHow to unlock continual service improvement with AIOps\\n      \\n        \\n          Discover how AIOps transforms IT operations from reactive to proactive.

But this past year, everything changed.\\n\\nHundreds of millions of people interacted with AI in a meaningful way for the first time. ChatGPT captured the world\\'s attention, and our industry entered the mainstream almost overnight, proving at once that a virtually seamless conversational support experience is possible with AI.\\n\\nBut robust enterprise AI isn\\'t built casually or overnight. It takes years of innovation that Moveworks has invested in perfecting conversational AI specifically for employee support.\\n\\nWhile competitors rush to catch up in the copilot space, Moveworks offers a mature platform backed by years of pioneering work in enterprise conversational AI. This gives us an unmatched advantage in leveraging large language models to provide robust employee assistance.\\n\\nTo back up and understand why ChatGPT was such a pivotal moment, we need to explore the technology powering it: large language models (LLMs). Today, I\\'ll explain how Moveworks harnesses LLMs to transform our customers’ businesses. I\\'ll break down:\\n\\nHow do large language models help provide conversational support\\n\\nWhat the Moveworks Enterprise Copilot Platform does\\n\\nHow Moveworks uses large language models\\n\\nHow Moveworks\\' custom model — MoveLM™ — is specially trained to provide enterprise support\\n\\nWhat it takes to implement large language models effectively and safely in the enterprise\\n\\nWhether you\\'re an IT leader, HR professional, CXO, CIO, CEO, or just fascinated by AI, you\\'ll learn how Moveworks leverages these advanced models to transform the world of work.\\n\\nHow do large language models help provide conversational support?\\n\\nLarge language models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s GPT-4, Google PaLM 2, and Meta’s LLaMA are driving the rise of AI copilots. But what exactly are these models, and how are they designed?\\n\\nLLMs are a specialized type of deep neural network optimized for understanding and generating natural language. They take in text inputs and are trained to predict upcoming words and sentences, allowing them to produce remarkably human-like writing.\\n\\nThe \"large\" refers to the massive scale of these models in terms of parameters. Parameters are the adjustable settings within a neural network that control its learning. More parameters mean greater complexity and nuance in the patterns a model can recognize.\\n\\nFor example, GPT-3, the predecessor to GPT-4, has a whopping 175 billion parameters! It was trained on hundreds of gigabytes of text data, including books, Wikipedia, websites, and more — over 300 billion words. This huge dataset and model capacity gives GPT-3 its versatility and eloquence.\\n\\nBut size isn\\'t everything. The architecture of LLMs is also key. They use a mechanism called transformers that allows them to learn contextual relationships between words based on the entire input text. Traditional language models struggled with longer-term dependencies. But transformers can connect information across long strings of text, just like humans can draw relationships between distant passages when reading.\\n\\nThanks to their massive scale and advanced transformer architecture, today\\'s LLMs have unmatched natural language capabilities compared to previous AI systems. They can:\\n\\nGenerate high-quality text spanning different tones, styles, and topics\\n\\nUnderstand contextual nuances and human intent within text\\n\\nAnswer questions based on passages of information\\n\\nTranslate between languages\\n\\nSummarize long texts into concise overviews\\n\\nThis combination of versatility and strong performance makes large language models a game-changer for conversational AI. Understanding how they work is key to further understanding how Moveworks can create such a human-like experience for employees to solve their everyday issues.\\n\\nWhat does Moveworks do?\\n\\nMoveworks provides a single conversational interface to surface information AND take action across every enterprise system.\\n\\nOur journey began with the goal of streamlining IT support using advanced natural language technology. We\\'ve painstakingly removed the need for training, scripting, or workflow setup, presenting a solution that takes care of the entire process, allowing your focus to remain on strategic endeavors.\\n\\nFast-forward to today, where the power of conversational AI has grown immensely. Every business leader is now looking to inject conversational AI into their enterprise.\\n\\nIT service desk,\\n\\nHR,\\n\\nFinance,\\n\\nFacilities, and more. In doing so, we enable employees worldwide to query, search, and take action on any system through\\n\\nmore than one hundred languages. In many cases, the user may not know exactly what back-end system they need to interface with or that the conversational AI is leveraging another system at all. The experience is seamless and magical. Language has become the only user interface that\\n\\nour customers’ employees will ever need to know.\\n\\nWhile other companies are starting to sprinkle ChatGPT experiences in their apps, Moveworks stands out. We\\'re not just talking about technology; we\\'re talking about enhancing large language models with all the bells and whistles you need for an enterprise-grade experience:\\n\\nNative integrations into all the major enterprise applications\\n\\nThe ability to take action and conduct structured data queries into every application\\n\\nUser-level and org-level grounding to make better decisions and maximize factuality\\n\\nDeveloper tools to create any custom use case in a scalable way\\n\\nEnterprise-grade analytics, content generation, and security and privacy\\n\\nFigure 1: Moveworks is the enterprise copilot platform that unifies all enterprise systems.\\n\\nHow Moveworks uses large language models\\n\\nMoveworks is an AI-powered enterprise copilot. It acts as a digital support agent that employees can chat with in plain language to get help with IT, HR, and other issues. Our platform understands questions and requests using a combination of different large language models:\\n\\nFoundation models like GPT-4 provide broad natural language understanding and generation capabilities. They enable Moveworks to parse varied employee questions and craft conversational responses.\\n\\nSmaller task-specific discriminative models are specialized for particular support functions, from basics like resetting passwords or ordering equipment to more complex functions such as domain classification or transferring certain tickets between HR, Legal, IT, etc. departments. These models ensure precision for common employee service needs.\\n\\nCustom model MoveLM is fine-tuned on Moveworks’ own enterprise data to improve performance on industry-, domain-, and company-specific vocabulary and workflows.\\n\\nTo connect these models, Moveworks also employs chaining — sequentially combining outputs from different models into an integrated experience. This AI architectural chaining enables Moveworks to deliver specialized precision within smooth, natural conversational experiences.\\n\\nFigure 2: Moveworks chains together outputs from different AI models to deliver specialized yet natural conversational experiences.\\n\\nFoundation models enable broad language tasks\\n\\nPowerful foundation models like GPT-4 and Bard provide general natural language capabilities. They allow Moveworks to excel at a wide range of language understanding and generation tasks:\\n\\nAnalyze the intent behind varied employee questions and requests. Foundation models\\' ability to model long-range dependencies allows the detection of nuance and context within questions.\\n\\nGenerate conversational responses tailored to each query. The flexibility of foundation models\\' enables crafting responses specific to the employee query.\\n\\nComplete general language tasks like searching knowledge bases or summarizing support articles. Foundation models are well-suited for language modeling and generation.\\n\\nThese foundation models understand nuance, context, and the latent human intent within employee questions, helping Moveworks handle various support needs expressed in natural language.\\n\\nFigure 3: Foundation models allow Moveworks to excel at understanding nuance, context, and intent within employee questions and generate tailored, natural responses.\\n\\nBalancing foundation models with task-specific discriminative models to ensure precision\\n\\nMoveworks combines the breadth of foundation models with the precision of task-specific models. This hybrid approach harnesses the strengths of both:\\n\\nFoundation models like GPT-3 provide broad language understanding and fluent conversational abilities. Their large scale and training on massive datasets impart strong general intelligence.\\n\\nTask-specific models complement this with specialized knowledge for high-accuracy responses. These include semantic search models like fine-tuned MPNet for improved search relevance or classifiers like fine-tuned FlanT5 to handoff users to the right support department.\\n\\nThese specialized models are highly optimized for precise automation of high-volume employee services. Their tuned knowledge significantly reduces errors and delivers the accuracy users demand.\\n\\nThe hybrid model architecture stacks transformers and specialized models. This enables Moveworks to balance robust language capabilities with deep expertise for specific tasks. The combination drives accurate, intelligent automation of complex enterprise needs.\\n\\nMoveworks’ specialized MoveLM™ understands enterprise needs\\n\\nMoveworks trained and deployed its large language model, MoveLM, customized on enterprise data. MoveLM is an instruction-based LLM supported by reinforcement learning with human feedback and trained on industry-specific terminology, workflows, and processes from Moveworks\\' experience working with hundreds of customers across industries and geographies.\\n\\nMoveLM provides:\\n\\nEnterprise vocabulary coverage so employees can use familiar terms\\n\\nOptimized handling of domain-specific tasks like contract reviews or deal desk inquiries\\n\\nAccuracy improvements from continued learning on new enterprise data\\n\\nThis enterprise tuning enhances Moveworks\\' ability to understand and resolve employee needs across verticals. The combination of broad transformer models, specialized task models, and custom enterprise MoveLM models allows Moveworks to deliver a robust employee service experience powered by AI, as demonstrated by the Enterprise LLM Benchmark.\\n\\nBy combining these models, Moveworks can handle the full scope of employee service needs. The right model is applied for each step of the support process. This orchestration of multiple models allows Moveworks to deliver a seamless, conversational employee experience while ensuring accuracy across a wide variety of tasks. The result is fast, frustration-free support.\\n\\nFigure 4: Unlike general foundation models, Moveworks trained its own large language model called MoveLM on enterprise data, enhancing its ability to understand and resolve employee needs across verticals and provide more accurate support.\\n\\nWhat it takes to implement large language models effectively and safely in the enterprise\\n\\nAs AI becomes central to employee service, it\\'s crucial to implement large language models thoughtfully. Here are key strategies:\\n\\nPick the right model mix\\n\\nEvaluate use cases. Smaller specialized models can provide precision for high-volume everyday tasks, while large transformer models offer broad capabilities for complex queries. Moveworks\\' MoveLM models add custom tuning on enterprise data.\\n\\nBalance tradeoffs. Leverage third-party pre-trained models combined with custom models tailored to your needs. Apply different specialized models at each stage of query resolution for optimal performance.\\n\\nRetrain regularly. Continued training keeps accuracy high despite evolving language, so reassess model performance and tune on new data.\\n\\nMitigate risks\\n\\nPrioritize data security. Techniques like synthetic data, anonymization, access controls, and compliance frameworks are essential to limit risks.\\n\\nMonitor model behavior: Audit models before models for potential bias, safety, and factual accuracy issues before deployment.\\n\\nFocus on controllability.

Khanwalker and Anandaramu will be instrumental in scaling the Bengaluru team — which is primarily focused on research and development for Moveworks’ cutting-edge AI copilot platform for the enterprise.\\n\\nSince opening its secondary headquarters in Bengaluru, India, in March 2022, Moveworks has seen rapid growth, now boasting over 50 team members. The team includes top engineering talent drawn directly from the region — with notable employees who honed their skills at industry giants like Google, Microsoft, Twitter, and more. Both Khanwalker and Anandaramu bring unique experience to the Moveworks team that will help solidify the company’s AI leadership in India and globally.\\n\\n“India has always been, and will continue to be, a critical region for us to grow our team,” said Vaibhav Nivargi, CTO and founder of Moveworks. “Having both Mayank and Rajesh on board will help us continue our aggressive growth trajectory and AI leadership now and in the future.”\\n\\nKhanwalker brings over 15 years of invaluable experience from Microsoft and Google — with a rich background in both technical and leadership roles. Beginning at Microsoft India, he contributed to Azure Active Directory before joining Google in 2014, where he successfully led the Gmail backend team. After a decade in the US, Khanwalker returned to India in 2021 to lead the Cloud Spanner team at Google Bangalore. His passion for cultivating strong technical teams and driving direct business impact led him to Moveworks, where he now joins the leadership team to chart the next phase of the company's growth in India.\\n\\n“There’s never been a better time to be working on high impact AI projects,” said Khanwalker. “Since the launch of ChatGPT, the market has been frantically trying to catch up with AI innovation — especially when it comes to large language models. Fortunately, Moveworks has been leading this charge for years now, making it the ideal company to join and help fuel its continued growth.”\\n\\nSimilarly, Anandaramu brings over 20 years of experience as a seasoned HR professional. He is most known for driving impactful people initiatives, and has a proven track record in talent management, employee engagement, and organizational development — all of which have led to exceptional results in start-ups and multinational corporations. Anandaramu's strategic approach to HR enhances employee satisfaction, retention, and overall organizational performance. His expertise in cultivating a positive work culture and fostering a diverse, inclusive workplace will play a pivotal role in driving Moveworks' growth and success.\\n\\n“India is home to some of the greatest engineering talent on the planet,” said Anandaramu. “Not only does Moveworks recognize this, it continues to invest in the Bengaluru team with aggressive hiring plans for the foreseeable future. It’s an honor to join the team at such a pivotal moment in their growth, and I’m excited to not only propel the team to the next level, but continue to extend Moveworks’ innovative and globally recognized culture to the India team.”\\n\\nNewsweek’s Global Most Loved Workplaces,\\n\\nInc.’s Best Workplace,\\n\\nSan Francisco Business Times’ Best Places to Work, and\\n\\nForbes Best Startup Employers in America.

Moveworks was recognized for its ability to understand the unique language of work — taking into account each employee’s location, permissions, language preference, and more.\\n\\nChatbots and virtual agents are now ubiquitous in our everyday lives — from Siri to Alexa to Google Home. But recreating this experience at work is incredibly challenging. Moveworks takes a groundbreaking approach to solve this problem at scale. The platform uses sophisticated AI, NLU, and machine learning to resolve employee requests. It can provision software, pass along policy updates, update permissions, request or troubleshoot hardware, look up people or places, surface knowledge base articles, and much more.\\n\\n“Natural language understanding has made great progress, but there simply aren’t any general-purpose NLU models that understand the unique language of work,” said James Johnson, managing director, AI Breakthrough. “Moveworks addresses this challenge head-on, helping support employees in a nearly effortless way, using world-leading AI to understand employee needs and take action automatically. Congratulations on being our choice for the 2022 ‘Best Overall Bot Solution.’”\\n\\nThis year’s program attracted more than 2,950 nominations from over 18 different countries throughout the world. Moveworks stood out for its breadth and depth of machine learning capabilities. The bot understands and resolves employee requests by flowing with the natural conversation of the user, correcting spelling mistakes, identifying unique employees, and breaking through the noise in the context of a single user interaction. And, while most chatbots and virtual agents are siloed applications, Moveworks intercepts employee requests on any channel — like email, slack, or an online forum. It then resolves those issues automatically or routes them to the appropriate department for accelerated support.\\n\\n“Building groundbreaking conversational AI that understands each employee’s unique needs was no easy feat,\" said Bhavin Shah, Moveworks CEO. \"That’s why we invested heavily in R&D from the start to ensure our solution could navigate these complexities with ease. This recognition from AI Breakthrough further validates the work our team puts in every day so companies from around the world can better support their employees through simple conversations with our AI.”\\n\\nBest Chatbot Solution\\n\\nin the 2021 AI Breakthrough Awards. And in 2022, the company was included in the\\n\\nForbes AI 50 list\\n\\nfor the fourth consecutive year.\\n\\nTo schedule a demo of Moveworks, visit:\\xa0https://www.moveworks.com/request-demo\\n\\nAbout Moveworks\\n\\nMoveworks is the AI platform that powers the best places to work.\\n\\nToday, employees deal with endless distractions: They wait days to get IT support, search through dozens of systems to find the new HR policy, and don\\'t learn about critical changes until it\\'s too late. Moveworks lets them focus on what really matters. Our AI platform gives employees support in seconds, just by asking for what they need, and enables leaders to prevent problems in advance.

Moveworks is being honored in the innovative services and software solutions category for its latest Natural Language Understanding-powered analytics solution: Employee Experience Insights (EXI). The Edison Awards™ recognizes some of the most innovative products and business leaders in the world — with past winners including Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, General Motors and Genentech.\\n\\nEXI is an analytics and insights solution that uses breakthrough techniques in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and machine learning to uncover the issues slowing employees down the most. It gives CIOs an actionable to-do list based on which initiatives will maximize productivity and ROI.\\n\\nA\\xa0recent report\\xa0found that 82% of leaders acknowledge that employees will consider leaving if their current employer does not provide access to the tools, technology, or information they need to do their jobs well. Nearly three in five employees who do experience this frustration said it makes them less productive. And yet, none of these leaders have had visibility into what’s slowing productivity and what’s not, so their ability to actually fix these problems is extremely limited. EXI is the first solution that solves this problem by offering a holistic view of what issues are slowing employees down and costing the business the most money as a result.\\n\\n“Every help desk is sitting on a treasure trove of information that could prevent future issues, before they happen,” said Bhavin Shah, CEO of Moveworks. “But business leaders have not yet been able to extract value from this data because the majority of AI models fail to understand the vast ambiguity of human language. EXI fundamentally solves this challenge — and this recognition further validates the positive impact it has on businesses around the world.”\\n\\nAll nominations are reviewed by the Edison Awards Steering Committee with the final ballot being determined by an independent judging panel. The panel is comprised of more than 3,000 senior business executives and academics from the fields of product development, design, engineering, science, marketing and education, as well as past winners.\\n\\nGold, Silver and Bronze winners will be announced at the Edison Awards Gala on Thursday, April 20, 2023 in Fort Myers, FL.

Applications for the 2024 awards will open midyear, 2023.\\n\\nAbout The Edison Awards:\\n\\nEstablished in 1987, the Edison Awards is a program conducted by Edison Universe, a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to fostering future innovators. The annual competition honors excellence in new product and service development, marketing, design and innovation. Past award recipients include Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, and leaders of global corporations such as Coca-Cola, Genentech, General Electric, General Motors, IBM and Campbell Soup Co. In 2022, the Edison Awards introduced the inaugural Lewis Latimer Fellowship program designed to celebrate, connect and bring together a community of innovative Black thought leaders.

In practice, this means taking complex processes like IT support and HR service delivery — which usually involve lots of manual effort from busy professionals — and automating them end-to-end, from the initial request for help to the full resolution of the issue.\\n\\nCreating this simple experience forced us to build machine learning components that are the first of their kind — at every step of the support process. So we did. The result of our effort is what we call the Moveworks Intelligence Engine™.\\n\\nThe Moveworks Intelligence Engine™\\n\\nLarge companies invest in hundreds of different systems to help employees work faster and be more productive. They fill their knowledge bases with pages upon pages of documentation, they create portals with forms for every type of request, and they even implement chatbots with a rudimentary understanding of language. But with so many convoluted and disconnected systems to navigate, the truth is that employees can’t get the resources they need quickly and easily.\\n\\nTake chatbots, for example. You’ve probably interacted with one in the last week, maybe even within the last 24 hours. They’re ubiquitous — and yet they’re often profoundly frustrating to use. Most chatbots either can’t understand what you need, or can’t ask the right follow-up questions, or can’t solve your problem without redirecting you to a person, whom you would’ve preferred to speak with in the first place.\\n\\nSo here’s the question: What would it take to create a chatbot that people actually prefer to use for support? To give employees whatever they need, right away, directly through the bot? Enter the Intelligence Engine. In this blog post, we’ll distill our learnings from the past five years to show how the Intelligence Engine tackles the five challenges of automating support at work:\\n\\nUnderstanding employee requests\\n\\nHolding conversations that don’t follow a script\\n\\nMaking the right decisions for each employee\\n\\nTransforming hard-to-use resources into bite-sized solutions\\n\\nMatching questions to the single best answer\\n\\nFigure 1: The Moveworks Intelligence Engine has five components, which work together to resolve employee support issues end-to-end.\\n\\nLanguage Core™: Knowing what employees need\\n\\nTo help employees, you need to understand what they are asking for.\\n\\nUnderstanding would be easy if everyone sought help in the same way, but they don’t. Sometimes employees use a lot of words or leave out context or mention something they think is relevant, but actually isn’t. And as we’ve discussed at length, it’s this ambiguity that makes it difficult for machines to figure out language.\\n\\nSo in approaching this challenge, you need a layer cake of dozens of deep learning models to correct spelling mistakes, to identify unique employees and software applications at each company, and to separate the signal from noise in the context of a single user. That’s why we built Language Core.\\n\\nFigure 2: Language Core breaks down and restructures complex requests to understand what an employee is looking for.\\n\\nLet’s look at an example. Here in Figure 2, John has quite a complex question, especially from the perspective of a computer. Does he need something provisioned? If so, which software? Could a knowledge base article solve his problem? Is he asking how to update his direct deposit? Request PTO? Troubleshoot his VPN connection?\\n\\nTo answer these questions, we first use two techniques: natural language processing (NLP) and natural language understanding (NLU). NLP organizes language into structured data — disambiguating entities, analyzing grammar, and correcting typos — while NLU interprets that data to figure out what it means in context. While the traditional way to build a chatbot fixates on specific use cases, we take any support issue, for any line of business, and map it into this structured framework that a computer can understand and act on.\\n\\nNow, once we’ve given the employee’s request the kind of structure that machine learning needs to understand, the next challenge to overcome is that every company has different employees, applications, office spaces, job titles, and security permissions. Here is where we use Collective Learning to see the unique ways that employees talk about these same issues. By combining information from many different companies and industries, our chatbot can recognize and interpret company-specific jargon that our models have never seen before.\\n\\nUsing all these techniques, Language Core is able to understand exactly what employees need — the first and most important step in making help at work automatic.\\n\\nDynamic Flow™: Holding natural conversations\\n\\nUnderstanding what a person says is one thing; keeping up with conversation in real-time is another.\\n\\nMost chatbots are terrible conversationalists simply because the unpredictability of real-world back-and-forth cannot be scripted out in advance. Instead of this rigid, hard-coded approach, a chatbot needs an adaptable framework for deciding next steps.\\n\\nDynamic Flow works to handle even the most erratic conversations by determining responses in real time. Instead of following a pre-programmed path, it analyzes conversational context to seamlessly shift between topics and generate dialog on the fly.\\n\\nFigure 3: While some conversations are straightforward, more often than not, employees have complicated issues that require a deep understanding of past interactions and current context to resolve.\\n\\nSo let’s return to John for a moment. Ideally, he would only have this one question about managing a distribution list. But we all know that the real world is more complicated. Much like John, we all jump between questions, reference past conversations, and don’t stick to a single topic. Adding even more complexity, issues themselves are fluid. Something that was once a priority might be irrelevant now. The only way for a chatbot to keep up is to be flexible.\\n\\nThat being said, most chatbots are not flexible. They dictate the flow of the conversation with scripted interactions. There’s no opportunity for a user to escape pre-set flow or add context.\\n\\nWith Dynamic Flow, the user starts and leads the conversation, exploring their topics of choice. This hands-off approach means that our bot engages naturally, adjusting to changing circumstances as they happen.\\n\\nAnd because the user is in command of the dialog, when they inevitably change their mind mid-conversation, there isn’t a pre-programmed loop to get stuck in. Instead, Dynamic Flow’s topic switching mechanism enables the chatbot to jump out of the recommended course at any time, moving the conversation in a different direction — all while remembering and returning to previous comments and questions, as needed.\\n\\nWith this approach, it’s possible for a chatbot to manage even the most ambiguous request — asking clarifying questions to further understand at every step of the conversation, presenting multiple solutions to move forward, adding comments to a ticket, and pulling information from the knowledge base.\\n\\nBy circumventing the hard-coded chatbot experience, Dynamic Flow creates a flexible conversation led by the user, ultimately transforming a frustrating interaction into a productive one.\\n\\nAction Bid™: Determining the ideal solution\\n\\nNow that we've understood and clarified what the employee needs, we have to serve up the most relevant solution available at their unique company.\\n\\nWe all know that the best way to make a decision is to consider all possible options. But businesses are highly complicated and constantly changing: they adopt new software, hire new employees, and announce new policies on a regular basis. The ideal solution to a given support issue today might become out-of-date tomorrow.\\n\\nSo the key to finding that ideal solution is keeping track of every possible solution to employee questions. Here’s where Action Bid comes into play.\\n\\nFigure 4: Different solutions bid for the opportunity to solve an issue. When one or multiple options reach the confidence threshold, a response is sent to the user in seconds.\\n\\nWhen John asks his question, there’s an infinity of ways to potentially address his request: remove someone from an email group, show contact information, surface a form, file a ticket, offer up a knowledge base article. And within these larger categories, there’re even more specific solutions — remove Jenny from the marketing distribution list, show contact information on Marshall on the Accounting Team, surface a request form, file an IT ticket on JIRA, offer up a single line from the Employee Handbook.\\n\\nFor every option, Action Bid weighs signals and context from across the company, considering every bit of information at its disposal — security permissions, job descriptions, business logic, location, past conversations — to calculate the relevance of each possible response to the employee’s question. Even as support teams add new content and the company ecosystem changes, Action Bid constantly improves to make sure that every decision is the best decision.\\n\\nEnterprise Cache™: Transforming resources into bite-sized solutions\\n\\nFor each service department — IT, HR, Finance, Legal, Facilities — tons of valuable information lives deep inside different resources and systems. And when an employee has a problem, they don’t know that they should be going to Confluence to troubleshoot their VPN issues, to Sharepoint for information on how to submit an expense report, or to the Okta portal to request access to a certain application.\\n\\nOn top of this first challenge, when a subject-matter expert writes an article, they are trying to document everything. This kind of detail can be difficult for employees to find, read, and understand. Knowledge articles can be thirty pages detailing retirement benefits, featuring information from a dozen different countries.\\n\\nThe key is wading through all this detail to get only the correct information in the right hands. And we’ve done this with Enterprise Cache — a system that transforms deeply buried resources into simple solutions designed to be rendered over chat.\\n\\nFigure 5: Moveworks personalizes the support experience by giving employees exactly the resource they need, whether that is a single sentence from a knowledge article or a conversationalized form.\\n\\nAs mentioned, when John asks his question there are a thousand possible solutions on the backend. Action Bid works to find out what type of solution is most meaningful for him. Maybe he needs an article on troubleshooting Outlook, contact information, access to marketing email software, a map to a certain conference room.\\n\\nEnterprise Cache works in tandem with Action Bid by making all this information useful to the end-user. It indexes all of the available resources, so every question can be answered with a single, precise snippet of information. Even when there are updates to various knowledge systems, Enterprise Cache automatically incorporates new information.\\n\\nAnd if the answer doesn’t live in your knowledge base? Enterprise Cache also ingests knowledge from trusted, public websites to make your answer store the best it can be.\\n\\nSemantic Match™: Personalized answers to every question\\n\\nEmployees expect personalized support. The same question doesn't always have the same answer, which is why support teams spend hours crafting personalized responses. Automating this process is a very difficult challenge, but it makes the difference between a typical automated system and a truly helpful solution\\n\\nSemantic Match provides precise answers to employees’ questions — directly over chat. It leverages relevance and personalization models to find the most helpful information across disparate knowledge bases.\\n\\nFigure 6: Keeping track of an employee’s location, department, and other context, Semantic Match surfaces the most relevant answer to each employee.\\n\\nFor example, if an employee — such as Jenny in Figure 5 above — asks for an update on retirement benefits — the bot can offer information based on her specific circumstances, like her location.\\n\\nThe power of Semantic Match is in how it intelligently surfaces information by considering context. Using all the capabilities of the other components of the Intelligence Engine, this system takes every disparate piece of data into account, from the proximity of certain words and phrases to the resources available to the location of the person asking.\\n\\nWith a 360-degree view of your organization, our proximity, relevance, and location models retrieve the most accurate answer. So even when an employee is vague, for example not mentioning where they are or which distribution list their referencing, Moveworks is able to connect them with the right solution. So employees get a quick and straightforward answer in seconds that's personalized to their specific circumstances.\\n\\nGreater than the sum of its parts\\n\\nEach component of the Moveworks Intelligence Engine — Language Core, Dynamic Flow, Action Bid, Enterprise Cache, and Semantic Match — takes a fundamentally novel approach to the problem it solves. Each pushes the limits of what’s possible with machine learning today.\\n\\nBut above all, it’s the tight integrations between these components that allow Moveworks to automate support at work. Semantic Match analyzes knowledge articles using Language Core to deliver personalized answers. Action Bid weighs the utility of all the resources in Enterprise Cache to determine the best solution. We’ve built one engine — with far more horsepower than its five parts alone.\\n\\nAnd here’s the biggest takeaway: if your solution fails to address just one of these challenges, employees won’t use it. A chatbot that understands language is still useless if it directs employees to an outdated article. A comprehensive IT portal lies dormant when people can’t find what they’re looking for.\\n\\nWe built our Intelligence Engine the hard way, putting thousands of hours of R&D into everything inside. Because otherwise, when your employees need support, they’d ask you instead.\\n\\nRequest a demo to see the Moveworks Intelligence Engine™ in action.\\n\\ntechnology\\n\\nMore blog posts\\n\\nHow to unlock continual service improvement with AIOps\\n      \\n        \\n          Discover how AIOps transforms IT operations from reactive to proactive.

But this past year, everything changed.\\n\\nUnlike simple chatbots, conversational AI utilizes advanced natural language processing, machine learning, and AI to enable natural, human-like interactions between computer systems and human users. This technology is poised to revolutionize healthcare delivery by streamlining workflows, improving access, and enhancing patient engagement.\\n\\nIn the sections that follow, we will highlight how conversational AI is currently being used in healthcare and showcase specific examples of organizations currently using conversational AI to enhance workflows, improve access, and create better patient experiences. The future of healthcare will undoubtedly include conversational AI as a core tool for delivering efficient, high-quality care. We’ll cover:\\n\\nWhat conversational AI is in healthcare\\n\\nConversational AI use cases in healthcare\\n\\nChallenges of conversational AI in healthcare\\n\\nThe benefits of conversational AI in healthcare\\n\\nHow conversational AI works in healthcare\\n\\nConversational AI strategy for healthcare\\n\\nWhat is conversational AI in healthcare?\\n\\nConversational AI represents a technological breakthrough that stands to benefit healthcare greatly. But before exploring its many use cases, it's essential to clarify precisely what conversational AI is.\\n\\nAt a basic level, conversational AI allows for natural, human-like interactions between computers and users. It utilizes advanced artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing to comprehend free-form human speech or text input. This is vastly more sophisticated than simple chatbots, which rely on scripted responses.\\n\\nTrue conversational AI has the flexibility and intelligence to respond appropriately to an infinite array of possible conversational scenarios. It can maintain context, ask clarifying questions, and handle complex interactions. Over time, conversational AI systems continuously improve through machine learning.\\n\\nHealthcare organizations implementing conversational AI are seeing improvements in efficiencies, access, costs, retention, and patient satisfaction by automating routine administrative tasks, freeing up staff for higher-value work, and more.\\n\\nConversational AI represents a new paradigm in human-computer interaction. This technology will soon become an indispensable tool for delivering modern healthcare. With this in mind, let’s look at some of the top use cases for conversational AI in healthcare.\\n\\nConversational AI use cases in healthcare\\n\\nConversational AI is transforming workflows and operations for healthcare providers in the following ways:\\n\\nAutomating high-volume administrative tasks, freeing up staff for more meaningful work.\\n\\nCentralizing access to knowledge into the natural workflow, reducing time spent toggling between systems.\\n\\nFacilitating the dissemination of new protocols, care guidelines, and announcements across the organization to keep all staff aligned.\\n\\nProactively addressing IT issues and commonly asked questions from staff. This prevents problems before they occur and reduces the burden on help desks.\\n\\nMonitoring utilization trends and other operational data to optimize supporting employees\\n\\nStreamlining workflows\\n\\nEnabling 24/7 self-service for common staff queries on HR policies, benefits, schedules, etc.\\n\\nOn the patient side, conversational AI has an equally long list of use cases:\\n\\nProviding automated appointment reminders and scheduling\\n\\nAnswering common patient questions about symptoms, treatments, medications, etc.\\n\\nGathering patient health history and insurance information\\n\\nSimplifying prescription refill requests\\n\\nGuiding patients through triage questions to assess urgency\\n\\nDelivering after-care instructions and follow-ups post-discharge\\n\\nOffering health coaching and chronic disease management\\n\\nEnabling voice-based interactions for telehealth visits\\n\\nAnalyzing usage patterns to provide personalized recommendations\\n\\nSending preventative care reminders to patients\\n\\nIntegrating with remote monitoring devices to track health data\\n\\nEmpowering patients to easily access medical records and test results\\n\\nThe overarching focus of all these examples is on using conversational AI to simplify workflows, surface the right information at the right time, and alleviate repetitive tasks — allowing healthcare professionals and patients alike to devote more time to delivering high-quality patient care and improving outcomes across the board.\\n\\nChallenges of conversational AI in healthcare\\n\\nWhile conversational AI offers immense potential, there are also important challenges that healthcare organizations need to address:\\n\\nCosts: Licensing fees, development, maintenance, and integration can require significant investment. Organizations need to balance costs against expected benefits.\\n\\nData privacy: Healthcare data is highly sensitive. Ensuring HIPAA compliance and patient privacy is paramount when implementing conversational AI that accesses PHI.\\n\\nRisks and uncertainty: As an emerging technology, best practices are still evolving. Managing risk around accuracy, security, and accountability is key in healthcare.\\n\\nIntegration difficulties: Integrating conversational AI with EHRs, billing systems, and other complex healthcare IT can be challenging, and as such, any AI implementation requires thoughtful design.\\n\\nLimited access to quality training data: Conversational AI relies on large volumes of representative healthcare data for training, which can be difficult for smaller organizations to obtain.\\n\\nLack of in-house AI expertise: Most healthcare organizations lack specialized AI/NLP talent to build and maintain complex conversational AI systems in-house. Relying on vendors is often necessary.\\n\\nWhile substantial, these challenges are not insurmountable. With careful planning, prudent vendor selection, and phased deployment focused on the highest impact areas, healthcare organizations can overcome these hurdles and realize significant value from conversational AI adoption. This technology presents an enormous opportunity to improve workflows, access, satisfaction, and care quality once implemented thoughtfully.\\n\\nEven with these challenges, the benefits are immeasurable to the industry and serve to provide positive impacts on patients, healthcare practitioners, and organizations.\\n\\nBenefits of conversational AI in healthcare\\n\\nDeploying conversational AI delivers significant benefits:\\n\\nIncreased productivity: By automating administrative tasks, conversational AI enables staff to focus on higher-value work.\\n\\nLower costs: Conversational AI reduces support tickets, phone calls, and other expenses associated with manual support.\\n\\nImproved satisfaction: Self-service boosts staff and patient satisfaction.\\n\\nBetter retention: Streamlining workflows and access to knowledge enhances retention of talent.\\n\\nHigher quality care: With more time spent on patients versus administrative tasks, care quality increases.\\n\\n24/7 availability: Patients and employees get quick answers to common questions at any time via conversational AI.\\n\\nAccelerated workflows: Immediate access to knowledge and automating requests speed up workflows.\\n\\nOverall, conversational AI reduces healthcare costs, unburdens staff, promotes engagement, and delivers higher quality patient care. Leading providers are achieving game-changing ROI from conversational AI.\\n\\nHow does conversational AI work in healthcare?\\n\\nWhen we talk about the healthcare sector, we aren’t referring solely to medical professionals such as doctors, nurses, medics, etc., but also to administrative staff at hospitals, clinics, and other healthcare facilities.\\n\\nHealthcare organizations like hospitals and clinics deal with a high volume of inquiries and requests from staff on a daily basis. These can range from administrative questions to issues with IT systems to guidance needed for patient care. During times of crisis like COVID-19, the flood of questions and the need for support skyrockets. This results in overwhelmed help desks and staff wasting time toggling between different systems or tracking down information.\\n\\nConversational AI provides a solution by automating responses to many routine, repetitive questions and tasks. With natural language capabilities and integration with backend systems, conversational AI-powered assistants, known as AI copilots, can act as support agents using advanced models to understand requests, analyze data, and deliver solutions.\\n\\nPowered by large language models (LLMs), these copilots possess deep knowledge across various systems and domains across a healthcare organization. They can respond contextually to a wide array of possible questions and conversations. And over time, the copilots continuously improve through machine learning.\\n\\nThe healthcare sector can undoubtedly benefit tremendously from such AI-driven customer care automation. Leading healthcare institutions have already implemented AI-powered copilots in partnership with Moveworks to improve their organizations' day-to-day and the patients they serve.\\n\\nWellstar powers self-service support with conversational AI that works out of the box\\n\\nWellstar, the largest and most integrated healthcare system in the state of Georgia, leverages conversational AI to enable employees to self-service their own IT support needs. The healthcare provider deployed Moveworks' copilot, affectionately called WALi, on their messaging platform. With natural language understanding, WALi has automated conversations with staff to resolve issues instantly.\\n\\nPowered by Moveworks' AI engine, WALi required no lengthy setup or manual dialog creation. It provided instant ROI by syncing with Wellstar's systems and adapting to users. Employees simply chat with WALi to get passwords reset, ask HR questions, or address other requests.\\n\\nWithin months, staff had over 100,000 conversations with the AI assistant. By empowering employees to self-serve, Wellstar reduced the burden on IT teams. Conversational AI delivers fast, personalized support, allowing over 26K healthcare employees to focus on patient care instead of tech hurdles.\\n\\nLuminis unites fragmented knowledge with conversational AI\\n\\nLuminis Health, a not-for-profit health system that serves 1.8 million people across central Maryland, leverages conversational AI to provide seamless access to information across its fragmented knowledge bases. The healthcare provider deployed Moveworks' AI copilot on Microsoft Teams. Named Lumi, the copilot is a single point of contact for employees to get support instantly within the tools they already use.\\n\\nPowered by natural language understanding, Lumi breaks down requests, maps them to relevant solutions across Luminis' many enterprise systems, and delivers personalized answers. This approach eliminates the need for employees to dig through separate knowledge bases or siloed documents. By unifying access to tribal knowledge, Lumi resolves issues in seconds without any back and forth.\\n\\nWithin two weeks of launch, call volume to Luminis' IT help desk dropped by 25%. Lumi automates routine requests so that agents can focus on high-impact initiatives. The conversational AI assistant unites fragmented information so that employees get the knowledge they need when they need it.\\n\\nVituity proactively communicates critical information with conversational AI\\n\\nVituity, one of the largest acute care providers in the United States, uses conversational AI to get ahead of issues with proactive messaging. Historically, the healthcare provider relied on mass emails to communicate with employees. But with inbox overload, these broadcast messages often went unread.\\n\\nTo address this, Vituity deployed a Moveworks copilot, Otto, on Microsoft Teams. With Moveworks for Employee Communications, Vituity sends targeted announcements to specific groups based on location, role, and preferences.\\n\\nOtto enables leaders to share critical, time-sensitive updates right within Teams conversations. The bot also measures message engagement, handles individual follow-ups, and reports back insights.\\n\\nBy replacing ineffective emails with personalized, interactive communications, Vituity keeps physicians informed proactively. Conversational AI transforms how they alert, educate, and inspire their distributed workforce.\\n\\nMass General Brigham fights frontline worker burnout with conversational AI\\n\\nAt Mass General Brigham (MGB), a not-for-profit integrated healthcare system and national leader in medical research, teaching, and patient care, the CIO is on a mission to combat burnout among the healthcare provider's 77,000 employees. With constant stress and round-the-clock demands, frontline workers, in particular, feel drained. The CIO realized technology could help relieve some of their burden.\\n\\nBy deploying Moveworks' copilot, MGB gave nurses, doctors, and other frontline staff an instant self-service IT solution right within the tools they already use. Instead of waiting on hold or submitting tickets, they get answers in seconds. This solution saves precious time they can devote to patient care instead of IT frustrations.\\n\\nBut the CIO didn't stop there. He sees listening as the key to leading with empathy. Using insights from Moveworks, the CIO better understands where employees are still struggling, allowing him to proactively improve their experience, whether streamlining workflows or providing new training.\\n\\nWith creative solutions that automate the small stuff while supporting overall well-being, MGB continues to drive down burnout. His high-tech, high-touch approach keeps mission-critical frontline workers engaged.\\n\\nConsiderations for building a conversational AI strategy for healthcare organizations\\n\\nHealthcare organizations have unique needs and challenges when implementing conversational AI. It's crucial to thoroughly evaluate platforms before investing, as deploying new technology like AI carries risks.\\n\\nHere are key considerations when building a healthcare conversational AI strategy:\\n\\nEase adoption by starting with automating painful tasks to prove value. Make usage seamless within existing workflows to minimize resistance from burnt-out staff.\\n\\nPrioritize security and compliance by working with HIPAA-compliant vendors with robust practices. Follow protected health information (PHI) protocols, including data handling and access controls.\\n\\nStart small and scale thoughtfully by rolling out limited use cases first before expanding capabilities. Then, move from simple to complex use cases once the initial ROI is proven.\\n\\nOptimize continuously by gathering feedback, expanding knowledge, and monitoring accuracy and usage metrics.

Widespread enthusiasm for the technology has created a modern-day gold rush, with everyone from casual users to corporations and investors joining the race to tap into its power.\\n\\nHowever, to fully embrace the power of AI, it\\'s essential to understand and address the risks it may introduce into an enterprise environment. Only by mitigating potential threats can we ensure successful — and secure — implementation.\\n\\nToday, we’ll shed light on the potential threats associated with the two main types of LLMs: generative models and discriminative models, focusing on their four main stages: pre-training, training, fine-tuning, and end customer usage.\\n\\nWith a primary focus on serving business needs, we\\'ll explore the following:\\n\\nLLM types and enterprise applications\\n\\nLLM threats in an enterprise\\n\\nMinimizing and mitigating these threats\\n\\nUnderstanding LLM types and their applications\\n\\nBusinesses that focus on adopting large language models (LLMs) typically focus on two types, generative models and discriminative models, each offering their own benefits in an enterprise environment.\\xa0 There are also offensive and defensive uses of LLMs for cybersecurity purposes, but this article doesn’t focus on those, and rather focuses specifically on safeguarding business applications of LLMs.\\n\\nBelow, we outline core threats and corresponding mitigation strategies for business LLM use across the lifecycle stages. While this list may not be exhaustive, we aim to capture essential information to guide users in this rapidly evolving field, ensuring constant improvement over time.\\n\\nWe define these two types of LLMs below:\\n\\nDiscriminative models distinguish the logical boundaries between datasets or labels. These models excel at scoring and categorizing material, such as identifying the most pertinent articles, highlighting critical information, or quickly replying with a yes or a no.\\n\\nGiven these skills, discriminative models are particularly good at classifying and ranking information. The output of this LLM could be a number or set of numbers to help organize information. For example, you could query a database of knowledge base articles, and the LLM will order the articles ranked by relevance for that query. And it is essential to note that these models can’t hallucinate in the same way as a generative model, though they might misclassify or incorrectly order content.\\n\\nGenerative models create new data based on probability and likelihood estimation between words. These models excel at creating content, such as text, code, and images, and effectively summarize articles. Adversely, these models can hallucinate, i.e., create incorrect content that looks real but can sometimes lead to inaccurate or false information.\\n\\nThis distinction between generative and discriminative models is essential since the threats and risks associated with each model type can vary depending on how the LLM gets used. The table below captures further practical LLM usage for business applications, followed by examples.\\n\\nDefinition \\n \\n \\n Example \\n \\n \\n \\n Using discriminative LLMs in the enterprise \\n \\n \\n \\n Classification \\n \\n \\n Assigning a data point to a specific category or group based on its characteristics \\n \\n \\n Predicting that an employee stating: “My headset broke, and I need a new one” is an IT request \\n \\n \\n \\n Ranking \\n \\n \\n Arranging data in a specific order based on certain criteria or a set of rules \\n \\n \\n Ranking three knowledge base articles in order of relevance to an employee’s request about obtaining a new headset \\n \\n \\n \\n Highlighting answers \\n \\n \\n Highlighting content to properly answer a question (i.e., rather than reading a wall of text, the actual response is highlighted) \\n \\n \\n Identifying specific text within an article to help an employee order a new headset \\n \\n \\n \\n Extractive slot-filling \\n \\n \\n Identifying and extracting specific pieces of information (or “slots”) from a given text. \\n \\n \\n Identifying and preparing API call arguments from user queries, like transforming \"What is the market cap of Apple?\" into GET_MARKET_CAP(company= \"Apple\"). \\n \\n \\n \\n Using generative LLMs in the enterprise \\n \\n \\n \\n Translation \\n \\n \\n Converting content from one language to another \\n \\n \\n Translating the input \"My headset broke, and I need a new one\" to its Spanish output \"Mis auriculares no funcionan y necesito nuevos.\" \\n \\n \\n \\n Summarization \\n \\n \\n Creating a concise and meaningful summary of a longer input text by understanding the key concepts and ideas and then generating a condensed version coherently and naturally. \\n \\n \\n Condensing (an existing) support article and using prior knowledge into a summary, presenting the main action items using its own words and paraphrasing the original content. \\n \\n \\n \\n Coding \\n \\n \\n Creating or improving machine-readable code \\n \\n \\n Drafting a Python script that provides the market cap of Fortune 100 companies without any additional input \\n \\n \\n \\n Content creation \\n \\n \\n Creating new content, including text, images, and more. \\n \\n \\n Drafting a sales outreach email \\n \\n \\n \\n Abstractive slot-filling\\xa0 \\n \\n \\n Enabling an LLM to generate API calls and arguments by reasoning and understanding user queries instead of directly extracting information from the input text. \\n \\n \\n Interpreting the query \"What is the market cap of the creator of the iPhone?\" and identifying \"Apple\" as the company in question and generating the API call GET_MARKET_CAP(company=“Apple”). \\n \\n \\n \\n Combining discriminative and generative LLMs in the enterprise \\n \\n \\n \\n Retrieval augmented generation \\n \\n \\n One or several discriminative models are used to search for relevant information, such as appropriate documents. to answer the question. Afterwards, a generative model is used to write the output from those documents. \\n \\n \\n Responding to the query, “My headset is not working,” with step-by-step instructions on resolving the issue instead of a set of links where the user has to click and review the material one by one manually.\\n\\nTable 1: Various uses for discriminative and generative LLMs in the enterprise.\\n\\nThe large language model lifecycle\\n\\nLLMs have revolutionized our interaction with artificial intelligence, enabling various applications like language translation and chatbots. However, understanding their lifecycle and potential risks is crucial for safe, effective deployment.\\n\\nThe lifecycle of an LLM can be broadly categorized into four major stages, each playing a pivotal role in shaping the model\\'s capabilities and performance:\\n\\nFigure 1: The large language model (LLM) lifecycle\\n\\nPre-training and training LLMs:\\xa0 LLMs are pre-trained on vast amounts of human-curated information to develop a generic knowledge base. This pre-training phase equips the model with a broad understanding of language patterns and concepts. During training, the LLM learns to predict the likelihood of a word or phrase appearing in a given context, further refining its language comprehension abilities.\\n\\nFine-tuning for specific applications: The LLM undergoes a fine-tuning process to tailor its capabilities for specific tasks or purposes. For instance, if the goal is to create a translation capability for a specific language, the LLM will be fine-tuned to understand idioms and nuances unique to that language. Fine-tuning allows for specialization and optimization, making the LLM more adept at specific applications.\\n\\nEnd customer usage: The LLM is deployed for end customer usage, typically through an API or a chat interface. It becomes an integral part of applications that interact with users. Although end customers do not have direct access to the underlying model, they interact with it seamlessly, benefiting from its language understanding capabilities.\\n\\nContinuous improvement through customer feedback: The journey of an LLM doesn\\'t end with deployment. This stage marks the beginning of an ongoing cycle of improvement. End customers\\' feedback plays a crucial role in fine-tuning the model further. The LLM is updated and refined to enhance its performance and accuracy as users report issues or provide feedback (including other models and annotators input). This iterative process helps the model stay relevant and adaptive to changing requirements. This stage could lead to privacy concerns for end users, which we’ll discuss below.\\n\\nUsing threat modeling to identify and address risks in the LLM lifecycle\\n\\nThreat modeling is a family of techniques that help us answer crucial questions of “what are we working on?” (including an LLM in a business application), “what can go wrong” (we read about a lot, and the structures in this article help us focus), and “what are we going to do about those things?” When we’ve done so, we can decide if the dangers of using the LLM are acceptable to us, and perhaps apply risk management techniques of acceptance or transfer to what remains. For more on threat modeling, see Adam’s The Ultimate Beginner\\'s Guide to Threat Modeling.\\n\\nPrivacy threats\\n\\nWe’d be remiss to not mention privacy, and we’re not going to go deep today because this post is already a little long.\\xa0 Privacy concerns may arise at any stage of the LLM lifecycle. Important strategies to mitigate these concerns involve using synthetic, anonymized, and/or masked data to decrease the risk of exposure — an issue that warrants further discussion.\\n\\nWe do want to touch on two important aspects. One of the first concerns that we hear talking about LLMs relates to “will data about me/data I provide be used to train the LLM?” We can break this down into “I’m concerned about trade secrets” and “Will the LLM reveal my data?” Trade secrets are an important legal concept, and understanding who’s training an LLM and how that LLM will be used can help you address the trade secret issue. We can also build tooling (“adapters”) that will customize the LLM to better safeguard data.\\n\\nAdapters help manage privacy considerations\\n\\nWe’ll emphasize a particular approach for handling sensitive data during fine-tuning: adapters. An adapter is a compact plugin for a global model. (We don’t want to delve too deeply into adapters, but they’re custom weights that are used to tune responses, say, for a specific company.)\\n\\nIt’s possible to use company specific data (say, “we use the term “partners” rather than “staff”) to create an adapter that helps the LLM answer questions using that terminology. That adapter can be specific to one company, and so even if it contains trade secrets, those secrets are not exposed to the global model, but are kept in an adapter, used for only that company.\\n\\nFor example, suppose the model needs to \"forget\" specific information or relearn a particular task, such as when using customer data. In that case, the adapter can be retrained with new data that omits the information that needs to be forgotten. This method proves to be more cost-effective and straightforward than retraining the global model.\\n\\nFigure 2: Adapters can help manage privacy considerations within the LLM lifecycle.\\n\\nSecurity threats and mitigation strategies\\n\\nWhen we talk about security threats to general computer systems, we tend to go to tools like STRIDE or Kill Chains to help us anticipate or explore “what can go wrong.” These techniques are powerful, general, and being general, don’t really help us anticipate the unusual and even unique problems associated with an LLM. (Both are introduced in Adam’s beginner guide to threat modeling under “common techniques.”)\\xa0 We can work on more specific threats that generalize to many LLMs or ML techniques, and we can get even more specific with attacks that work against a particular LLM or release of an LLM.\\n\\nThreats for discriminative LLMs throughout their lifecycle\\n\\nNow, we can explore potential threats and corresponding mitigation strategies for discriminative LLMs across various lifecycle stages. This information aims to provide a solid understanding of key concerns and their remedies, and it is not meant to be comprehensive.\\n\\nThreat \\n \\n \\n Definition \\n \\n \\n Stages To Address \\n \\n \\n Mitigation \\n \\n \\n \\n Biased classification \\n \\n \\n Skewed predictions due to imbalanced data representation \\n \\n \\n Pre-training and training, and Fine-tuning \\n \\n \\n Ensure your dataset is well-balanced across different classes, including a diverse range of examples and features for each class. This diversity helps avoid overemphasizing specific characteristics and ensures unbiased outcomes when applying the model to real-world scenarios.\\xa0 \\n \\n \\n \\n Poisoning the training dataset \\n \\n \\n Introducing harmful data into the training set \\n \\n \\n Pre-training and training \\n \\n \\n Implement machine-assisted dataset reviews to identify and eliminate any inappropriate or unsuitable data during the training phase. This maintains the integrity of your model and ensures that the resulting LLM is reliable and accurate. \\n \\n \\n \\n Ranking bias \\n \\n \\n Distorted rankings due to unrepresentative data \\n \\n \\n Pre-training and training, and Fine-tuning \\n \\n \\n Create a balanced, task-specific dataset encompassing diverse ordering scenarios to minimize the influence of malicious data during the fine-tuning process.\\xa0 \\n \\n \\n \\n Overfitting \\n \\n \\n Excessive specialization on training data \\n \\n \\n Pre-training and training\\xa0 \\n \\n \\n Use a heterogeneous dataset with diverse examples and fine-tune your training process. Employ regularization techniques, cross-validation, and early stopping to prevent overfitting. This approach ensures the model can effectively handle real-world data rather than fitting too closely to the training data alone. \\n \\n \\n \\n Uninformative highlighting \\n \\n \\n Failing to pinpoint relevant information \\n \\n \\n Fine-tuning \\n \\n \\n Ensure the dataset is task-specific, well-balanced, and focuses on a diverse range of salient aspects for answer highlighting. Fine-tuning with such data, even in the presence of malicious content in the model, minimizes its negative impact on the system. \\n \\n \\n \\n Parsing attack \\n \\n \\n Inability to properly parse the request (such as identifying parameters when doing extractive slot-filling) \\n \\n \\n Fine-tuning, and End-customer use \\n \\n \\n During the fine-tuning stage, construct a dataset that includes a diverse range of ways to describe the content, such as, API parameters, alongside incorporating human-curated content. \\n During end-customer usage, implement a filter or validator to assess the validity and range of generated parameters after the LLM process but before they are consumed by the API. This ensures that only correct and acceptable parameters are utilized.\\xa0 \\n \\n \\n \\n (Direct) Prompt injection \\n \\n \\n Malicious input influencing model \\n \\n \\n End-customer use \\n \\n \\n Use an augmented and balanced dataset with a diverse set of examples to minimize the impact of prompt injection attacks. \\n Ideally, specific tasks/instructions can be trained into the models to mitigate risks associated with prompt injection attacks. Unlike instruction-following models like ChatGPT, which take their instructions from the text they are provided (and are consequently susceptible to following a different instruction taken from user text or article text),  specific tasks/instructions  are trained into the model itself in advance. In other words, we aim to separate instructions and data by default to prevent and mitigate this risk. \\n \\n \\n \\n Data leakage \\n \\n \\n Revealing sensitive information \\n \\n \\n End-customer use \\n \\n \\n Ensure proper access control at the API level is in place based on end user access. This should also mitigate blind injection attacks that attempt to infer sensitive data based on yes/no responses. Ensure that failure code paths fail gracefully and are thoroughly tested (i.e. aiming to prevent the LLM “defaulting” to the wrong classification for example).\\n\\nTable 2: Threats and mitigations for discriminative LLMs throughout their lifecycle\\n\\nThreats for generative LLMs throughout their lifecycle\\n\\nThe below table outlines the threats and mitigations that can occur in the different stages of a generative LLM lifecycle. As mentioned earlier, this is not meant to be comprehensive but provide visibility into key threats.\\n\\nThreat \\n \\n \\n Definition \\n \\n \\n Stages To Address \\n \\n \\n Mitigation \\n \\n \\n \\n Poisoning the training dataset \\n \\n \\n Inserting harmful data \\n \\n \\n Pre-training and training \\n \\n \\n Leverage  in-context learning  by providing positive examples at runtime to guide the model\\'s behavior. Additionally, train the model to incorporate human-curated (including machine-assisted dataset review) or annotated content and static reference material. \\n \\n \\n \\n Vocabulary  limitations and biases \\n \\n \\n Inserting harmful data \\n \\n \\n Pre-training and training, and fine tuning \\n \\n \\n Expand the training dataset by adding relevant idioms, terminology, and language examples. Also include human-annotated content to help minimize biases. \\n \\n \\n \\n (Direct) Prompt injection  ( see also ) \\n \\n \\n Malicious input influencing model \\n \\n \\n End-customer use \\n \\n \\n Depending on how the LLM will be used the mitigations will differ. We share a few examples below: - Translation: Validating whether the model\\'s output has been translated and ideally translating it back to see if it matches to a reasonable degree of accuracy. \\n - Summarization and Content Creation: Reduce the level of access the LLM has and the actions that could be taken by the LLM (on behalf of the user) based on the response generated. In some instances, proper access control or having human oversight might mitigate the risk. \\n - API parameter generation: Implement a filter or validator to assess the validity and range of generated parameters after the LLM process but before they are consumed by the API. This ensures that only correct and acceptable parameters are utilized. \\n \\n \\n \\n Data leakage \\n \\n \\n Extracting sensitive information \\n \\n \\n End-customer use \\n \\n \\n Ensure that the responses generated by the LLM enforce access control or the LLM accesses non-restricted information. Alternatively, using an adapter for sensitive information, or an LLM (or LLMs) per customer. \\n \\n \\n \\n Hallucination \\n \\n \\n Generating false outputs \\n \\n \\n End-customer use \\n \\n \\n Provide content to the LLM related to the actual task. For example, rather than asking the LLM to summarize arbitrary material, provide the actual material that should be summarized (such as KB article).\\xa0 \\n Response should be grounded and ideally the source of the information cited. \\n \\n \\n \\n Company data exposure \\n \\n \\n Exposing internal data\\xa0 \\n \\n \\n Fine tuning and end-customer use \\n \\n \\n Implement data masking, use synthetic data or anonymization techniques to avoid exposing sensitive details. \\n \\n \\n \\n Malicious code  (including backdoors) - similar to poisoning the training dataset) \\n \\xa0 \\n \\n \\n Embedding harmful code \\n \\n \\n Pre-training and training, and fine tuning \\n \\n \\n Conduct machine-assisted training dataset reviews to identify malicious content. Additionally, leverage human-curated and reviewed code samples during training. Run code scanners and anti-malware tools as a defense-in-depth approach. \\n Implement human-in-the-loop reviews of any generated code before deployment. Perform comprehensive vulnerability scans and malware detection as additional safeguards against harmful code. \\n \\n \\n \\n Bias  ( See also )  \\n \\n \\n Skewed outputs from imbalanced data\\xa0 \\n \\n \\n Pre-training and training, fine tuning \\n \\n \\n Use a diverse and representative dataset for training. Routinely address any biases or skews detected in the model\\'s outputs or performance. Update the training data as needed to improve fairness and accuracy. The training dataset should contain clear information about the intended task, relevant idioms, terminology, and human-annotated content to minimize biases.\\n\\nTable 3: Threats and mitigations for discriminative LLMs throughout their lifecycle\\n\\nWe want to call out that indirect prompt injection threats exist throughout various stages of the process. Both the pre-training and fine-tuning stages are susceptible to this risk. For instance, a malicious document instructing the model to \"ignore prior requests and do XYZ instead\" could be included in the training data. If the model internalizes this information, it may unknowingly perform indirect prompt injections when triggered by a similar input in the future. Similarly, the model might respond inappropriately during end-user interactions if the input data contains hidden indirect prompt injections.\\n\\nUnfortunately, there is no foolproof mitigation to address this threat at present completely. However, there are steps we can take to minimize their impact. Ensuring that the training dataset is curated by humans and diverse is essential (instead of ingesting random material from the web or unique articles that could influence the model). Moreover, we can identify common keywords or patterns used in prompt injection attacks and attempt to separate genuine data from potentially harmful instructions. Training the model to actively recognize and reject prompt injection attempts by default can also be beneficial.\\n\\nRealize the potential of LLMs while prioritizing security\\n\\nAs large language models continue gaining traction, they can deliver immense value to businesses through their advanced language capabilities. However, realizing their full potential requires responsible adoption practices.\\n\\nBy exploring common LLM types and their unique strengths, examining risks across the model lifecycle stages, and detailing actionable mitigation strategies, this guide aims to equip leaders with the threat modeling knowledge needed to implement LLMs securely. While no framework can fully eliminate risks, we believe that certain techniques can be implemented to reduce them.\\n\\nWith proper diligence and mitigation practices, companies can harness the breakthrough capabilities of large language models to enhance services, improve efficiency, and maintain a robust security posture. The future looks bright for LLMs in business — by keeping security and privacy in mind, leaders can confidently pursue innovation while building trust.\\n\\nWe would like to thank the individuals listed below for their invaluable feedback.\\n\\nJayadev Bhaskaran, Machine Learning Engineer\\n\\nMatthew Mistele, Tech Lead Manager, NLU\\n\\nTodd Macdonald, Software Engineer\\n\\nYi Liu, Vice President, Engineering\\n\\nChang Liu, Director, Engineering\\n\\nAdditional resources\\n\\nIn addition to the resources shared earlier, we found the below resources useful as we learned and worked on this material.\\n\\nGPT-4 System Card\\n\\nOWASP Top Ten LLM Threats\\n\\nThreat Modeling: Designing for Security, Adam Shostack (Wiley, 2014)\\n\\nMitigating Unwanted Biases with Adversarial Learning\\n\\nLearn more about what it takes to ensure conversational AI security for the enterprise.\\n\\nbest practices\\n\\nMore blog posts\\n\\nHow to unlock continual service improvement with AIOps\\n      \\n        \\n          Discover how AIOps transforms IT operations from reactive to proactive.

We’ve worked diligently to craft a conversational interface that works across systems powered by large language models (LLMs). It is this foundation that enables our technology innovation and company growth. And it is also this foundation that leads our customers like Hearst, Broadcom, and Palo Alto Networks to trust and value both our out-of-the-box solutions and developer tools to bring conversational automation to all business functions.\\n\\nOur values are what guide us, which is why we are honored to be named to the Forbes 2023 Cloud 100 list, which spotlights companies that pair strong values with top performance.\\n\\nThe Cloud 100 is a prestigious annual list of the world's top 100 private cloud companies — produced by Forbes in partnership with Bessemer Venture Partners and Salesforce Ventures. It recognizes standout companies in the cloud technology sector ranging from small startups to major private-equity-backed organizations, such as Stripe, Figma, Databricks, and a long list of other groundbreaking companies. The five key values that make this award so important are: Teamwork, Transparency & Honesty, Putting the Customer First, Ownership, Ambition & Boldness.\\n\\nThis award and the values it promotes affirm that the world now knows what’s possible with conversational AI. We’ve all seen its latest advancements accomplishing tasks unimaginable when we launched Moveworks seven years ago. Today, every business leader is now looking to inject conversational AI into their enterprise.\\n\\nMoveworks stays ahead of the curve.\\n\\nBefore the recent AI boom, when many were still unaware of the potential for conversational AI in business, Moveworks was trailblazing and developing enterprise solutions as far back as 2016.\\n\\nWe started by using natural language understanding (NLU) to automate IT support tasks with zero maintenance required. But today, our platform goes beyond support to connect employees to every enterprise system through an AI-powered conversational interface.\\n\\nWe’ve focused on making conversational AI seamlessly accessible across the enterprise with an out-of-the-box enterprise copilot that integrates with hundreds of applications, engages in more than one hundred languages, and leverages a stack of specialized large language models to give employees a single intelligent assistant to get work done, instead of navigating complex apps.\\n\\nAs a result, we’ve received notable recognition, not only in this year’s Cloud 100 list but also in the Forbes AI 50 five years running and in the AI Breakthrough Awards for best natural language generation platform.\\n\\nHowever, awards reflect outcomes, not how results are achieved.\\n\\nWhile we've received recognition for our innovative AI platform, we are most proud of our industry-leading conversational AI technology, the real-world results we deliver for customers, and our team that makes it all happen.\\n\\nMoveworks is an enterprise-wide copilot platform.\\n\\nWhat sets Moveworks apart is our long-term focus on scalable, secure, and ethical integration of AI across the enterprise. We invest deeply in data privacy, security, and responsible AI practices. This includes leveraging data centers in the EU and Canada and robust model testing and evaluation.\\n\\nOn the technical side, our accumulated domain- and task-specific data, unique insight into our customers’ needs, and ever-maturing MLOps system and teams feed into our success. To get here, we’ve invested in both headcount and technology. Our annotators, machine learning engineers, data scientists, and more work together to bring real AI to the enterprise.\\n\\nWith Moveworks’ expert team, you get access to best-in-class models, including OpenAI’s GPT-4 for search relevance, Google’s BERT for intent classification, and Meta’s RoBERTa for entity recognition.\\n\\nYou get models fine-tuned and grounded with over 500 million support tickets, over 10 billion bot conversations, and more than 100 million enterprise resources to ensure the language models understand the language of work. And you get a solution that provides users precisely what they need when they need it.\\n\\nWe aim to provide the most effective enterprise AI platform through an approach rooted in our values. We’ve upheld this commitment for over seven years of technology innovation and will continue to exemplify what it takes to be at the forefront of this growing industry disrupter. As conversational AI goes mainstream, we are proud to remain leaders doing it the right way — enabling employees with an AI assistant they can trust.\\n\\nMoveworks puts customers first with conversational AI for every enterprise.\\n\\nRapid advances in LLMs and NLU, culminating in the release of ChatGPT, have brought conversational AI to the forefront of society. And as a result, enterprises face a business imperative: incorporate conversational AI into their tech stacks.\\n\\nThe thing is that we believe AI doesn’t have to be ungainly, esoteric, and brutal to work with — that’s why Moveworks makes building with advanced, optimized conversational AI technology easy.\\n\\nHere’s how we help our customers adopt this technology as effectively as possible.\\n\\nMoveworks makes advanced conversational AI easily accessible for any enterprise use case. Our platform layers intelligent conversational interfaces on top of existing systems — no ripping and replacing required. This allows enterprises to incorporate AI at their own pace and empowers various functions across IT, HR and more to build tailored AI experiences without complex coding required.\\n\\nWe remain at the forefront of AI investment to fuel our customers’ continued success. And we intend to continue focusing resources on advancing conversational AI for the enterprise.\\n\\nBut more than providing access to cutting-edge technology, Moveworks puts customers first. Our conversational AI solutions start and end with enabling every team to work smarter and be more productive. We handle the complex AI so you can focus on results. Moveworks strives to be the easiest, most effective way to make conversational AI work for the enterprise.\\n\\nMoveworks empowers its employess\\n\\nAt Moveworks, employees are the heart and soul of the company. We believe that fostering a culture of diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging is not just good for its employees, it’s good for business. In short — we believe our employees are our most valuable assets.\\n\\nAs a global company with teams spread across Europe, India, Canada, Australia, and the United States, we provide the tools and flexibility for employees to thrive anywhere. We also drink our own champagne — leveraging Moveworks' AI platform internally to assist our teams.\\n\\nWe cherish our inclusive, equitable culture where everyone belongs. A majority of leadership roles are held by people with diverse backgrounds. Plus, we build in practices to reduce bias in hiring, compensation, and beyond.\\n\\nWe care about enabling each person to grow through benefits, learning opportunities, and employee resource groups like Women In Sales and Working Parents. Employees take risks, stretch their skills, and lift each other up.\\n\\nOur employees drive our success. Moveworks is committed to creating an environment where every person can thrive and reach their full potential. When our people grow, we all rise.\\n\\nMoveworks is driving the future of conversational AI.\\n\\nConversational AI is now a business imperative with the category poised for massive growth. As the market expands, Moveworks is proud to remain an industry leader in advancing enterprise adoption.\\n\\nOur inclusion in the prestigious Cloud 100 affirms our impact. But more importantly, it's our long-term commitment to responsible, scalable AI that enables our success.\\n\\nWe lead in research and development to push boundaries. And we put users first — guiding partners and customers to create AI that solves real business challenges, allowing companies to unlock productivity and create magical experiences for employees and customers alike.\\n\\nAs conversational AI continues on its upward trajectory, we are similarly just getting started.

The partnership allows joint customers to provide seamless support to their employees at any time, in any language, and from any location.\\n\\nWith the shift to “work from anywhere,” employees need immediate support to stay productive, whether they have an IT issue, an HR request, or a question about the expense policy. Conventional service desks can’t achieve the speed and scale required to deliver 24/7 help, in real time, to a hybrid workforce. Today, service desks take an average of three days to resolve employees’ issues, which ultimately reduces productivity and engagement across the company. The Moveworks and TCS partnership aims to eliminate this problem altogether — by giving employees the support they need in a matter of seconds, not days.\\n\\n“Progressive enterprises are adopting artificial intelligence and other digital technologies to enhance the overall employee experience,” said K Ananth Krishnan, Chief Technology Officer, TCS. “This partnership with Moveworks will enable our customers to transform their service desks with AI. They can rely on our expertise and Moveworks’ technology to support their workforce, automatically.”\\n\\nMutual clients of Moveworks and TCS have greatly reduced their service desk costs as well as their mean time to resolution (MTTR) — including some of the top automakers, healthcare providers, and technology vendors from around the world. TCS’ deep domain knowledge and technology expertise — combined with the powerful Moveworks platform — allows these customers to provide the kind of workplace experience their employees expect, along with detailed insights to measure their service quality. Global insurance broker,\\xa0AssuredPartners, relies on both companies for its employee support needs.\\n\\n“Traditional IT service desk models simply aren’t sufficient in meeting all of our employees’ support needs,” said Sankha Ghosh, CIO at AssuredPartners. “Both TCS and Moveworks have been instrumental in helping us transform our overall employee experience. The new digital solution allows our employees to get the technology support they need in a matter of minutes — not days — so they can focus on things that really matter.”\\n\\n“To create a world-class employee experience, companies need both their business knowledge and sophisticated technology that can address the nuances of their unique digital business. TCS leverages its deep contextual knowledge and digital champions to overcome these specific challenges, while Moveworks’ AI autonomously learns the intricacies of each customer environment,” said Anupam Singhal, Business Head, Financial Services, Tata Consultancy Services. “Together, TCS and Moveworks empower service desks to make supporting employees effortless.”\\n\\n“The nature of work has fundamentally changed, which means businesses need to completely rethink the way they support their employees,” said Bhavin Shah, CEO of Moveworks. “Our partnership with TCS is about empowering businesses to meet their employees’ expectations — by providing a single place they can go for instant support. With the help of TCS, this experience will be the gold standard for businesses around the world.”\\n\\nAbout Moveworks\\n\\nMoveworks is the AI platform that powers the best places to work.\\n\\nToday, employees deal with endless distractions: They wait days to get IT support, search through dozens of systems to find the new HR policy, and don’t learn about critical changes until it’s too late. Moveworks lets them focus on what really matters. Our AI platform gives employees support in seconds, just by asking for what they need, and enables leaders to prevent problems in advance. With Moveworks, companies like Hearst, DocuSign, and Broadcom make work magic.\\n\\nFor more information, visit:\\xa0Moveworks.com\\n\\nAbout Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)\\n\\nTata Consultancy Services is an IT services, consulting, and business solutions organization that has been partnering with many of the world’s largest businesses in their transformation journeys for over 50 years.

It may even spell the end of the traditional web as we know it.\\n\\nIn fact, insights from this week’s Forrester Technology & Innovation Summit reveal that generative AI may be the most important technology of our lifetime. No wonder enterprise CIOs and their teams are prioritizing investments to stay competitive.\\n\\nThe good news? AI tools, like copilots, can deliver quick wins by automating repetitive tasks, freeing up employees. These early successes can pave the way for more advanced implementations.\\n\\nBut simply implementing new tools isn't enough. To fully leverage generative AI requires a thoughtful approach. In upcoming sections, we'll recap key learnings from Forrester around:\\n\\nMaking generative AI an urgent business priority\\n\\nBalancing risks and governance amidst acceleration\\n\\nDeploying copilots for immediate productivity gains\\n\\nMake generative AI an urgent business priority.\\n\\nGenerative AI isn't a new concept, but its meteoric rise to prominence in the past year has transformed it into an absolute necessity for businesses. So, why is it imperative? The reasons discussed at Forrester are compelling:\\n\\nUnlocking untapped value: Generative AI, when harnessed effectively, has the remarkable power to automate mundane tasks and unearth invaluable insights from data. This capability empowers enterprises to scale their operations efficiently. The applications are limitless, from streamlining supply chains to crafting engaging marketing content. In fact — a recent Forrester study found that 61% of AI leaders see innovation as a key benefit. The potential value is too great to ignore.\\n\\nThe rise of conversational interfaces: Since ChatGPT and its peers burst onto the scene, it’s clear conversational AI removes friction and unlocks generative models' full potential. The days of searching through the disorganized web seem archaic now. Natural language is undeniably the future.\\n\\nImmediate scalability for enterprises: Tailored models designed specifically for enterprises and particular domains are ushering in a new era of swift and customized AI solutions deployment. Thanks to the capabilities of cloud-scale computing, the impact of these solutions can be extended across an organization rapidly.\\n\\nAccelerating momentum: The momentum behind generative AI adoption is rapidly gaining speed, driven by the realization that waiting on the sidelines risks obsolescence. Enterprises stand to gain immense efficiency, foster innovation, and experience robust growth by adopting a privacy- and security-focused approach to this technology.\\n\\nWhile it's true that certain risks linger, the moment to harness the potential of this extraordinary technology is now. By establishing a solid foundation in generative AI today, you're not just making progress for the present but setting your business on a trajectory of success for years to come.\\n\\nFigure 1: The Moveworks team at Forrester's Technology & Innovation Forum\\n\\nKeep value central to balance generative AI risks and rewards.\\n\\nWith solutions ranging from app-specific copilots to standalone LLMs to custom development options to everything in between, choosing the right solution for your enterprise is crucial.\\n\\nMany organizations rely on simplistic AI workflows that are maintenance-heavy and limited. While promising, it's crucial to recognize that some solutions may be more about hype than actual business value.\\n\\nAs advised by Forrester, a comprehensive evaluation should revolve around three key aspects:\\n\\nTechnology readiness: Is the chosen solution equipped to effectively address specific business problems and generate tangible value?\\n\\nArchitectural preparedness: Is your existing architecture poised to seamlessly integrate and adopt the chosen AI solution?\\n\\nOrganizational readiness: Does your organization possess the necessary skills and processes to maximize the potential of this generative AI solution?\\n\\nUnderstanding these questions and, more importantly, their corresponding answers within the unique context of your organization forms the bedrock for making well-informed decisions. By balancing the associated risks and rewards in alignment with the overarching goal of delivering value, companies can tap into the extraordinary potential of AI while avoiding the allure of hype-driven solutions that ultimately fail to address real-world challenges.\\n\\nAs you navigate these ever-changing AI waters, keep value at the center. By grounding the generative AI\\xa0 journey in tangible benefits, enterprises can elevate every facet of their operations, ensuring that innovation is purposeful and impactful.\\n\\nJamf shows off the power of getting the risk-reward balance right.\\n\\nIn one Forrester session, Melissa Dunham of Jamf shared how deploying Moveworks' copilot, internally called Caspernicus, led to tremendous productivity gains across their organization — by balancing risks and rewards.\\n\\nFigure 2: At Jamf, a Moveworks copilot named Caspernicus started to drive value for employees and support teams from day one.\\n\\nIn just a short period after implementation, Caspernicus:\\n\\nBecame the go-to resource for 70%+ of employees\\n\\nResolved nearly 70% of issues without human escalation\\n\\nEnabled instant software provisioning through automated approvals\\n\\nDelivered contextual knowledge base suggestions\\n\\nEfficiently handled high-volume Slack channels\\n\\nWith Caspernicus handling repetitive support tasks at scale, Jamf's IT team can now focus on more strategic initiatives. Just as crucially, employee frustration is reduced by preventing ticket overload.\\n\\nAnd by empowering Jamf's workforce to operate at its peak, Caspernicus elevates the employee experience through seamless, instant support. As one example, automated software provisioning makes approvals instant, eliminates catalog searching, and enables frictionless onboarding.\\n\\nAs Dunham explained, meeting employees in tools they already use, like Slack, is key for adoption.

With ChatGPT leading the way, this vision is on its way to becoming a reality.\\n\\nHaving seen firsthand what ChatGPT can do, it should come as no surprise that businesses are eager to understand the implications of chatbots and conversational AI for their operations and how to leverage this tech for success.\\n\\nHowever, the widespread media buzz around this tech has blurred the lines between chatbots and conversational AI. Even though the terms are often used interchangeably, it's crucial to understand their differences to make informed decisions for your organization.\\n\\nToday’s topic: chatbots vs. conversational AI. You'll leave with a better understanding of the following:\\n\\nWhat is a chatbot\\n\\nWhat is conversational AI\\n\\nThe difference between chatbots and conversational AI\\n\\nConversational AI chatbot use cases\\n\\nHow to make conversational AI chatbots work for the enterprise\\n\\nWhat is a chatbot?\\n\\nA chatbot is a tool that can simulate human conversation and interact with users through text or voice-based interfaces.\\n\\nWhen most people talk about chatbots, they’re referring to rules-based chatbots. Also known as toolkit chatbots, these tools rely on keyword matching and pre-determined scripts to answer the most basic FAQs.\\n\\nCrucially, these bots depend on a team of engineers to build every single flow, and if a user deviates from the pre-built script, the bot will not be able to keep up.\\n\\nFigure 1: Rules-based chatbots with pre-scripted responses can’t keep up\\n\\nwith unexpected user responses.\\n\\nWhat is conversational AI?\\n\\nConversational AI is a technology that enables machines to understand, interpret, and respond to natural language in a way that mimics human conversation.\\n\\nFor example, there are AI chatbots that offer a more natural and intuitive conversational experience than rules-based chatbots. AI chatbots use probabilistic machine learning models, natural language understanding (NLU), and conversational flow management (CFM) to understand what the user wants, hold contextual conversations, make real-time decisions, and proceed with the next actionable next steps.\\n\\nConversational AI technology can be used to power various applications beyond just chatbots. Voice assistants, like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant, are examples of conversational AI tools that use voice as the primary input to interpret and respond to user requests.\\n\\nVirtual assistants are another type of conversational AI that can perform tasks for users based on voice or text commands. These can be standalone applications or integrated into other systems, such as customer support chatbots or smart home systems.\\n\\nFigure 2: Conversations can go in an infinite number of directions.\\n\\nConversational AI chatbots are flexible enough to keep up in the face of uncertainty.\\n\\nWhat are the disadvantages of conversational AI?\\n\\nOne of the biggest drawbacks of conversational AI is its limitation to text-only input and output. Because conversational AI is often trained on large language models — models trained on text — users were restricted to communicating through written messages and receiving responses in text form, which could be cumbersome and time-consuming.\\n\\nHowever, with the emergence of GPT-4 and other large multimodal models, this limitation has been addressed, allowing for more natural and seamless interactions with machines. Multimodal conversational AI has been trained on more than text. As a result, conversational AI that leverages multimodal models can now process and generate various media forms, including images, audio, and video, making it more versatile and capable of meeting users' diverse communication preferences.\\n\\nChatbots vs. conversational AI: What's the difference?\\n\\nNot all chatbots use conversational AI, and conversational AI can power more than just chatbots.\\n\\nThink of chatbots as one possible application of conversational AI. Conversational AI is a broader concept encompassing chatbots but also includes other technologies and applications involving natural language processing and human-machine interaction.\\n\\nConversational AI can power chatbots to make them more sophisticated and effective. While rules-based chatbots can be effective for simple, scripted interactions, conversational AI offers a whole new level of power and potential. With the ability to learn, adapt, and make decisions independently, conversational AI transforms how we interact with machines and help organizations unlock new efficiencies and opportunities.\\n\\nWhat are conversational AI chatbot use cases?\\n\\nAs businesses increasingly turn to digital solutions for customer engagement and internal operations, chatbots and conversational AI are becoming more prevalent in the enterprise. They are hailed as the universal interface between people and digital systems.\\n\\nHere are some examples of how both are currently used to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance the user experience in various industries:\\n\\nChatbots in the enterprise\\n\\nCustomer Service Chatbots: Many companies use chatbots to support their customers. These chatbots can handle simple queries and provide quick responses to customers.\\n\\nEmployee Support Chatbots: Chatbots can be used in human resources, IT, finance, and facilities departments to provide employees with quick responses to their queries regarding policies, benefits, and troubleshooting other support-related issues.\\n\\nSales Chatbots: Chatbots can assist sales teams by engaging with potential customers, answering their questions, and guiding them through the sales process.\\n\\nConversational AI in the enterprise\\n\\nIntelligent Personal Assistants: Some companies use conversational AI to develop intelligent personal assistants for their employees. These assistants can help employees with tasks such as scheduling meetings, setting reminders, and sending emails.\\n\\nPredictive Maintenance: Conversational AI can predict maintenance issues by analyzing data and alerting support teams before a problem occurs.\\n\\nFraud Detection: Conversational AI can be used in financial institutions to detect fraud by analyzing customer behavior and identifying anomalies and preventing fraudulent transactions before they occur.\\n\\nContent Generation: Generate help center articles in IT, create internal communication memos for company-wide initiatives in HR, and even generate ad copy for marketing campaigns with conversational AI.\\n\\nLow-Code/No-Code Development: Conversational AI can help developers build with natural language, provide automated code review and analysis, and assist with documentation and knowledge management. Anyone can build a solution in minutes – not days, months, or years – for any use case imaginable.\\n\\nHow to make conversational AI that works for the enterprise\\n\\nWith ChatGPT and GPT-4 making recent headlines, conversational AI has gained popularity across industries due to the wide range of use cases it can help with. But simply making API calls to ChatGPT or integrating with a singular large language model won't give you the results you want in an enterprise setting.\\n\\nFor a conversational AI chatbot to create a lasting impact within an enterprise, it needs to connect each system and application across an enterprise, allow them to communicate seamlessly, and then take action based on the user's needs. Without deep integrations with company-specific data and the systems and apps within your organization, conversational AI use cases will be lackluster at best and downright useless at worst.\\n\\nFor instance, while you could ask a chatbot like ChatGPT to add you to a sales distribution list, it doesn’t have the knowledge or ability to understand and act on your request.\\n\\nIf, on the other hand, an enterprise uses a conversational AI chatbot specifically tailored to their organization and integrated with their tech stack, it would be able to comprehend the request and add you to the correct list.\\n\\nAlthough the spotlight is currently on chatGPT, the challenge many companies may have and potentially continue to face is the false promise of rules-based chatbots. Many enterprises attempt to use rules-based chatbots for tasks, requiring extensive maintenance to prevent the workflows from breaking down.\\n\\nIt’s clear that rules-based chatbots dependent on brittle dialogue flows and scripts simply don't work, but up until recently, they were the only option available. With recent advancements in conversational AI, that's changed. Now, businesses can use this technology to build custom use cases without sacrificing the integrity of the output.\\n\\nWith conversational AI, building these use cases should not require significant IT resources or talent. Instead, conversational AI can help facilitate the creation of chatbot use cases and launch them live through natural language conversations without complicated dialog flows.\\n\\nConversational AI is the new way to engage in the enterprise\\n\\nConversational AI is rapidly becoming the foundation upon which the tech of the future will be built.\\n\\nMajor companies like Google, Microsoft, and Meta are heavily investing in the technology and building their own offerings. With the advent of advanced technologies like LLMs and ChatGPT, the enterprise is set to be transformed in ways we can hardly imagine.\\n\\nTo learn more about the history and future of conversational AI in the enterprise, I highly recommend checking out the Microsoft-hosted webinar on how ChatGPT is transforming enterprise support. It's a great way to stay informed and stay ahead of the curve on this exciting new technology.

That's where conversational AI comes in.\\n\\nBy using chatbots and other conversational tools, companies can provide instant help to their customers, reducing wait times and freeing up support teams to focus on more complex tasks.\\n\\nBut the benefits of conversational AI go beyond just customer service. For example, in HR, conversational AI can automate tasks like scheduling interviews, answering employee queries, and managing leave requests, taking the burden off of HR professionals and allowing them to focus on more strategic work.\\n\\nAnother major advantage of conversational AI is the potential to improve the employee experience. By automating tedious and repetitive tasks, AI can help employees can focus on more high-value activities that require human expertise, ultimately increasing job satisfaction and productivity.\\n\\nAnd let's not forget about the potential for conversational AI to promote diversity and reduce bias in decision-making. By standardizing processes and decision-making based on objective data — rather than subjective human judgment — conversational AI can help businesses make more fair and unbiased decisions.\\n\\nAll in all, it's no surprise that businesses of all types are eagerly adopting conversational AI. With the potential to increase efficiency, improve customer service, and enhance employee experience, conversational AI is quickly becoming a must-have tool for modern businesses.\\n\\n5 conversational AI examples\\n\\n1. Unity levels up its tech support with conversational AI on Slack\\n\\nUnity, a leading platform for creating and operating interactive, real-time 3D content, successfully implemented conversational AI to enhance its employee experience.\\n\\nThe company's CIO, Brian Hoyt, emphasizes the importance of employee experience and how it plays a crucial role in enhancing overall organizational performance. With employees submitting their IT issues on an #ask-IT Slack channel, Unity’s support team had to keep track of dozens of ad-hoc issues.\\n\\nThanks to Conversational AI, the service desk was able to address a significant portion of these issues automatically. All employees had to do was ask a conversational AI chatbot. Instead of waiting days for support, employees now get help in less than a minute resulting in a happy team. More than 90 percent of Unity’s employees are satisfied with their IT experience!\\n\\n“Employee experience is my top priority. Having employees submit IT issues on a Slack channel posed some unique challenges, but we do it because employees like it. And with AI addressing a lot of those issues automatically, our service desk likes it, too.”\\n\\n— Brian Hoyt, Former CIO, Unity\\n\\n2. Luminis Health uses conversational AI to support frontline healthcare workers\\n\\nConversational AI is transforming various industries, including healthcare. It offers numerous benefits, from improved patient care to enhanced operational efficiency. One such example is Luminis Health, where IT Director Andre Green implemented conversational AI to up-level his team and provide better services to patients.\\n\\nOne of the most significant advantages of conversational AI in healthcare is its ability to automate routine tasks. For instance, AI-powered bots can handle password resets, appointment scheduling, and other repetitive tasks, freeing healthcare workers' time to focus on more critical responsibilities.\\n\\nWith conversational AI resolving issues remotely and instantly, often without agent intervention, Green saw a 25% reduction in IT call volume two weeks after launching a conversational AI chatbot.\\n\\nIt is worth noting that implementing conversational AI is not about replacing human resources; instead, it is an opportunity to up-level team members by allowing them to focus on high-value tasks. According to Green, investing in AI is an investment in the team's upskilling, enabling them to work more efficiently and productively.\\n\\nLuminis Health's success in implementing conversational AI highlights the technology's potential to revolutionize the healthcare industry.\\n\\n“Investing in AI is not about replacing FTEs. It’s an opportunity to up-level your team. You don’t use your people, your most valuable resource, to reset passwords. AI can take care of that.”\\n\\n— Andre Green, IT Director, Luminis Health\\n\\n3. Verisk supports its global workforce in seconds with conversational AI\\n\\nGlobalization has revolutionized how companies operate, with businesses having employees distributed worldwide. However, this distribution presents a challenge for support, as providing timely and efficient support to every employee is often not feasible.\\n\\nFor example, following some acquisitions, Verisk needed to onboard thousands of new employees across the UK, Spain, and Asia-Pacific, and at the same time, each new company possessed its own systems and processes.\\n\\nThat’s why Verisk's IT leaders recognized the need for a robust support system to deliver personalized and consistent support across the organization. They knew rules-based chatbots would struggle to hold a natural conversation in their complex environment, so they turned to conversational AI as the solution. As a result, more than 96% of Verisk’s employees — around the world — now rely on a conversational AI chatbot for support.\\n\\nConversational AI chatbots are a game-changer for global businesses, providing always-on, efficient, and personalized support, regardless of employees' locations. Integrating AI technology in IT support is an investment in the company's future, ensuring they can deliver top-notch support services to employees irrespective of location.\\n\\n“Having a chat-based interface was crucial as we globalized our help desk. With conversational AI, we’ve completely eliminated the waiting, friction, and language barriers that come with asking for help over the phone.”\\n\\n— Bill Merritt, Global Helpdesk Manager,\\xa0Verisk\\n\\n4.\\xa0Medallia turns to conversational AI when employees need help\\n\\nAt Medallia, conversational AI is not just a tool for basic question-answering or category prediction; it's an integral part of the company's approach to managing permissions and entitlements, provisioning applications, and enabling employees.\\n\\nWhile many enterprises are still exploring the possibilities of AI, Medallia has taken bold steps toward transforming its business with this technology. Immediately after the conversational AI chatbot’s implementation was complete, Medallia employees could engage with Jarvis conversationally on Slack to instantly self-service their tech issues, from unlocking accounts to resetting MFA tokens to accessing new software.\\n\\nProblems that once took several days to fix manually were suddenly resolved in seconds — fundamentally transforming the experience for employees and the IT team.\\n\\nConversational AI has allowed Medallia to leverage AI and automation to level previously thought unattainable, and the results have been impressive.\\n\\n“Most enterprises are still thinking about AI as a solution for simple question-answering or category prediction, but we’re using it for managing permissions and entitlements, provisioning applications, and employee enablement.”\\n\\n— Ashwin Ballal, CIO,\\xa0Medallia\\n\\n5. Albemarle doubles employee productivity with conversational AI\\n\\nFor global enterprises like the Albemarle Corporation, providing consistent, high-quality IT support to all employees, regardless of location or language, can be daunting. But with the help of conversational AI, Albemarle has achieved this goal.\\n\\nThe company's CIO, Patrick Thompson, explains that the conversational AI chatbot provides 24/7 help to employees in their native language, allowing everyone to get the support they need quickly and easily without the need for localized service desks around the world.\\n\\nIn addition to providing IT support to employees, conversational AI can pull insights from backend IT systems, helping Albemarle turn thousands of requests into a simple, actionable to-do list.\\n\\nWhile current ITSM insights tools focus primarily on tickets and SLAs, conversational AI can help companies identify trends and issues before they become major problems and proactively address them. This approach offers Albemarle’s support leaders granular insights, allowing them to immediately see and address inefficiencies across the company.\\n\\n“With AI, we can provide the same high-quality support to every employee, no matter which languages they speak. It gives our people 24/7 help in their native language, conversationally. Now, they can get support right away without us needing localized service desks all over the world.”\\n\\n— Patrick Thompson, CIO,\\xa0Albemarle Corporation\\n\\nHow conversational AI can help your business\\n\\nConversational AI is transforming the business landscape in unprecedented ways, and its adoption is only accelerating. As we've seen, companies across all industries are embracing this technology to streamline processes, enhance customer satisfaction, and improve the employee experience.\\n\\nThe examples we've discussed in this article illustrate the versatility and power of conversational AI, from reducing IT support wait times to improving patient care in healthcare settings.

As a support professional, you already know this. Unlocking an account or updating benefits should be intuitive, not complicated.\\n\\nThat said, every service department — HR, IT, Finance, Facilities — has a different approach to supporting employees. And every employee has different habits and preferences when it comes to getting help. This means that your whole workforce has to learn when to submit a form through an IT portal, when to directly email a colleague on the HR team, and when to ask the entire company for help on a public Slack channel.\\n\\nomnichannel support. With this approach, employees can get personalized help, no matter where they go.\\n\\nWhat is omnichannel support?\\n\\nOmnichannel support means employees can use whichever channel they prefer to get help and receive the same seamless experience. Whether an employee sends an email or a chat message, they get the information they need in the place most convenient to them. With this strategy, employees can help themselves, and your team has the time to focus on improving the support ecosystem as a whole.\\n\\nWith omnichannel support — no matter which channel an employee prefers — they:\\n\\nGet the same help\\n\\nHave the same simple experience\\n\\nReceive personalized solutions\\n\\nFigure 1: To ensure a positive employee experience, support teams must provide the same great experience on every channel.\\n\\nThe same help on every channel\\n\\nA common challenge for support teams is that there’s often a different strategy for every channel. The IT team might focus on setting up automation in Microsoft Teams, while the HR team is trying to direct all support traffic to their web portal. As a result, employees don’t know where to go, which portal to use, who to email, or where to chat.\\n\\nEmployees should be able to get support where they’re already working, whether in the office, at home, or in the field. That’s why I recommend support teams think backward from the end-user experience. Instead of starting with improving phone support or encouraging everyone to ask questions on Slack — let people go where they want to go, use the tools they want to use, and take full advantage of all the automation you’ve worked hard to build.\\n\\nA critical step in building a modern support process is ensuring consistency across every channel within your organization. With an omnichannel support mindset, you can integrate your environment in a way that’s synchronized. The same solutions can live in the messaging platforms, the enterprise web portals, and the email accounts that your employees use every day.\\n\\nFigure 2:\\n\\nMoveworks lives in the messaging platforms employees use every day, picking up and continuing conversations from other support channels, as needed\\n\\nOne simple interface everywhere\\n\\nThe goal of omnichannel support is to help employees help themselves. So once you’ve ensured the same access to support across channels, step two is creating the same exact experience everywhere. Because, more often than not, every support system has an entirely different interface. No one has to learn how to use a new portal or remember the correct email address to get hardware help.\\n\\nDon't force employees to think too hard about support. With the right strategy and tools, employees don’t have to learn yet another system. What I've seen is that — by far — a conversational interface offers the most seamless experience. Employees use natural language to get what they need. They don’t need to learn new buttons to click; they can just type a question and get an answer.\\n\\nWith a conversational interface that lives on every support channel, you’ll create a universal stepping-off point to get help. Employees will always know where to go and how to ask for help.\\n\\nFigure 3: With Moveworks for Web, users who prefer to get help on enterprise portals can easily access all the skills, features, forms, and knowledge at Moveworks’ disposal.\\n\\nPersonalized support where you work\\n\\nThe final step of building omnichannel support is customization. If you send an important memo about changing healthcare benefits, you want employees to see it and engage. But, when some people prefer email and others live in Microsoft Teams, there’s a high probability that your message will go unnoticed.\\n\\nMeeting employees where they are involves knowing who an employee is and keeping track of their preferences. By combining conversational AI with a deep understanding of identity, you can tailor support for every employee automatically and reach out to them on the channels where they expect support. This keeps information from falling through the cracks while ensuring that users aren’t overloaded with the same information across different channels.\\n\\nWhen every employee has a secure profile that knows their department, location, and preferred support channel, it’s easy to engage in a meaningful and timely way.\\n\\nFigure 4:\\n\\nMoveworks personalizes messages to cut through the noise. By precisely targeting comms based on employees’ locations and support preferences, our bot meets employees on their terms\\n\\nMeet employees on their terms\\n\\nThe mark of a truly mature support process is a great employee experience. And the foundation of a great employee experience is meeting employees on their terms.\\n\\nInstead of getting stuck in the mindset of providing the bare minimum across every single channel — checking boxes by setting up email, chat, and web support — you increasingly need to think about how to bring every support channel together into a single omnichannel experience.\\n\\nSee how omnichannel support transformed Palo Alto Networks' employee experience.\\n\\nbest practices\\n\\nproduct features\\n\\nemployee experience\\n\\nMore blog posts\\n\\nHow to unlock continual service improvement with AIOps\\n      \\n        \\n          Discover how AIOps transforms IT operations from reactive to proactive.

In critical tasks, can you confidently rely on these systems?\\n\\nGrounding, a key concept in the rapidly evolving field of AI, offers a potential solution. It helps develop AI systems that are better prepared to interact with the real world, with the goal of minimizing the risk of inaccurate results.\\n\\nIn this article, we’ll explore the fundamentals of grounding AI, highlighting its crucial role in advancing AI decision-making. By the end, you will have a comprehensive understanding of grounding, including its incredible potential in shaping the future of AI systems that can engage with the complexities of the real world.\\n\\nWe’ll cover:\\n\\nA fundamental understanding of what grounding is\\n\\nWhy it’s important in content generation and decision-making\\n\\nTechniques used for grounding AI models\\n\\nBenefits to grounding AI in the enterprise\\n\\nReal-life applications of grounding AI\\n\\nWhat is grounding AI transformation?\\n\\nGrounding AI in machine learning refers to the process of linking abstract knowledge in AI systems to tangible, real-world examples. This enhances an AI\\'s ability to produce better predictions and responses by using specific, contextually relevant information.\\n\\nIn the realm of language models, grounding AI involves giving large language models (LLMs) access to use-case specific information, which is not inherently part of their training data. By including explicitly cited data, a grounded model can generate more precise and contextually relevant output.\\n\\nTo go a bit deeper, generative LLMs produce text using two primary methods. In one way, the LLM relies on the knowledge and understanding gained from its training data. And in the other way, the model is provided with specific information (e.g., for summarization) and instructed to either use that information alone or combine it with its inherent knowledge to generate the text.\\n\\nUltimately, grounding AI aims to build machine learning solutions that intelligently and effectively operate in real-world situations, offering users contextually appropriate, accurate, and meaningful results. As you can imagine, grounding becomes important because that is the way we can influence LLM outputs to be customized to the knowledge of a particular organization.\\n\\nIt\\'s important to clarify that grounding does not refer to training a model with annotated data containing the information to be used for generating the response, as this would be known as supervised learning. Instead, grounding specifically relates to guiding a generative language model to generate responses that incorporate explicitly referenced information.\\n\\nWhy is grounding important?\\n\\nWhen an AI system needs to be accurate and factual in what it generates, grounding is key. This is especially true in an enterprise environment when you need to ensure a high threshold of accuracy in the answers the AI generates when those outputs are going to employees or customers.\\n\\nGrounded AI systems are superior to non-grounded systems as they connect their abstract knowledge with the specifics of real-world scenarios. This enables them to generate more accurate, contextually relevant responses in comparison to non-grounded systems, which may struggle to incorporate case-specific information, leading to irrelevant or inaccurate outputs. In this way, we can harness the power of LLMs while improving the odds of getting fluent but accurate responses.\\n\\nGrounding can minimize hallucinations in large language models\\n\\nOne intriguing aspect of large language models (LLMs) is the occurrence of the \"hallucination\" effect. Hallucination occurs when an AI generates outputs that sometimes appear reasonable but are not entirely accurate based on the given context. And in some rarer cases — an LLM could surface information that is just plain wrong.\\n\\nThat said, hallucinations are not inherently negative, as they can demonstrate an AI model\\'s ability to create inventive text and responses. However, if hallucinations lead to misleading outputs or if they reflect leaked world knowledge, they become problematic.\\n\\nRecognizing the types and impacts of hallucinations is essential in determining their acceptability. Generally, hallucinations are less concerning in conversational responses, where there is no specific ground truth, and the goal is to generate text consistent with the overall context and tone.\\n\\nFor instance, when answering a question like, \"How many dinosaurs were in the Jurassic period?\", the AI\\'s response may provide the correct information, approximately 2-4 billion, alongside a long list of unneeded information, including the comparison to the number of people on Earth today. This type of hallucination is acceptable since the essential part of the answer remains accurate, and the additional information doesn\\'t significantly affect the response\\'s value. But the following text contains an egregious error, as there are significantly more than 2-4 billion people alive on Earth today.\\n\\nFigure 1: If we provided the LLM with a Wikipedia article on the Jurassic period and told it to only use that article, but it still produced text that was not supported by that article, that would also be a hallucination — even if the entire generated response was accurate.\\n\\nThis is to say that hallucination is an intrinsic characteristic of AI systems and sometimes can be beneficial. The key is identifying when hallucinations are problematic and mitigating their drawbacks while harnessing their potential for producing more engaging and contextually relevant AI-generated responses. This is where grounding plays a vital role.\\n\\nGrounding improves AI decision-making\\n\\nParticularly in enterprise settings, AI systems are increasingly relied upon to make critical decisions, offer recommendations, or provide solutions that directly impact business operations. In such scenarios, accuracy becomes a non-negotiable requirement. Grounding AI ensures that the AI model\\'s understanding is closely linked to the real-world context, minimizing errors and maximizing the relevance of the generated outputs.\\n\\nBy grounding AI, systems can better decipher the surrounding context, filter through available data, and process information in a manner that reflects real-world situations. This ability significantly enhances decision-making capabilities, as the AI system can draw from specific and relevant data sources to produce outputs that are aligned with the scenario at hand.\\n\\nGrounding helps AI better interpret and process complex situations\\n\\nAI systems often encounter difficulties when interpreting and processing complex real-world data. Identifying and addressing these challenges is crucial for developing AI models that can provide meaningful and effective responses in a wide array of applications. Some challenges faced by AI systems when understanding real-world data include:\\n\\nNuanced language: AI models may struggle to correctly interpret sarcasm, humor, idiomatic expressions, or other linguistic nuances. This can lead to misunderstanding context and producing incorrect or irrelevant outputs.\\n\\nAmbiguity: Real-world data often contain vague or ambiguous information, making it difficult for AI systems to extract precise meaning and build proper context around the data they process.\\n\\nInconsistencies in data: Real-world data can often be unstructured, containing inconsistencies, omissions, or contradictions. AI systems must learn to handle these inconsistencies effectively to produce reliable results.\\n\\nMultimodal data: AI systems may need to process and integrate information from various sources and formats, including text, voice, images, and video. Each data type presents its unique challenges for interpretation and processing.\\n\\nThe consequences of the challenges listed above are that training is not always able to imbue the model with everything it needs to produce a contextually relevant response. Grounding helps the model to produce better results, without being limited by its training data.\\n\\nExample: Helping employees look up information with grounded LLMs\\n\\nSuppose we want to use a tool to determine the office location of an employee named Mike Jordan.\\n\\nUsing an ungrounded LLM, which only generates text based on the model\\'s learning, we might encounter some issues. For instance, the ungrounded LLM could wrongly assume that our query is about basketball legend Michael Jordan and provide an irrelevant, albeit factually accurate, answer. Here, the model is making a leap in saying that Michael Jordan\\'s office is in Charlotte based on the fact that his team was based there. That is an assumption, and it\\'s not clear whether the model had access to any concrete evidence about the location of Jordan’s office.\\n\\nOn the other hand, if we utilize a grounded LLM connected to an internal employee roster, we can experience a more accurate and helpful response. Once prompted with relevant employee search results containing details about Mike Jordan, such as his title, tenure, location, email, and phone number, the grounded LLM can quickly provide us with the correct answer: \"Mike Jordan is based in San Francisco, CA, and their title is IT Director.\"\\n\\nBy employing a grounded LLM in this scenario, we can ensure that the information provided is both accurate and efficient, significantly enhancing the employee data lookup process.\\n\\nFigure 2: Grounding prevents a language model from being misled by unrelated information.\\n\\nGrounding helps helps develop ML models that excel in complex real-world scenarios\\n\\nAI systems must overcome a myriad of challenges to excel in interpreting and processing complex real-world data. Grounding AI models in real-world knowledge and providing them with sufficient contextual understanding are essential steps in addressing these challenges.\\n\\nBy equipping AI models with the ability to seamlessly adapt to different contexts, data formats, and linguistic nuances, enterprises can harness AI\\'s capabilities more effectively and ensure their systems are well-suited to address an extensive range of use cases across various industries.\\n\\nFundamentals for understanding grounding AI\\n\\nBefore diving deeper, it\\'s essential to have a basic understanding of two main types of machine learning (ML) models: discriminative and generative models.\\n\\nDiscriminative models are the more widespread category, which allow for tasks like predicting variable values or classifying items into categories. The primary function of these models is to map an input to an output value or category. For instance, a discriminative model can help determine whether an email is spam or non-spam, based on the input features, such as the email\\'s content, sender information, and subject line.\\n\\nOn the other hand, generative models produce variations or examples of the input. To do this, these models must grasp the input\\'s essence and create examples based on specific input requirements. For instance, these models can learn the essential elements of writing a professional email and generate completely new emails that cater to specific situations — such as crafting a friendly reminder to colleagues about an upcoming deadline or composing a thoughtful request for additional project resources.\\n\\nGenerative models, like GPT-4, are powerful due to their exposure to billions of text pieces during training, which has enabled them to understand what a well written poem or novel or research paper looks like, to the extent that something like ChatGPT can produce similar pieces of text, literally predicting one word at a time. On top of that, generative models can be further fine-tuned to take instructions in plain language to produce this text to match some requirements.\\n\\nFundamentals for understanding grounding AI\\n\\nThe key to grounding is finding a way to guide your LLM to produce responses that only use your data, rather than restricting its trained knowledge. By doing so, you can incorporate case-specific, relevant information that enhances your AI model\\'s understanding and processing capabilities in real-world situations.\\n\\nThe goal is to control the AI model\\'s behavior so that it utilizes explicitly provided information — without resorting to filling in blanks to create content or respond to questions.\\n\\nTechniques and strategies for grounding AI models\\n\\nTo improve the accuracy of AI models, especially in generating contextually relevant responses, we can employ several grounding techniques. Here\\'s a closer look at three key methods:\\n\\nUsing external knowledge bases and vector databases\\n\\nLLMs can benefit from incorporating external knowledge or databases, providing additional data and context for more effective grounding. By employing semantic search, the relevant and similar text between a user\\'s query and available content can be quickly identified, enhancing the responses generated through retrieval augmented generation. This can be achieved by including the retrieved data in the LLM prompt or enabling API access to the data source.\\n\\nVector databases are particularly powerful due to their use of semantic keyword-assisted search, which combines the advantages of both keyword and semantic search. Semantic search leverages the concept of embeddings – a representation of text in “semantic space”, where similar phrases are closely mapped and unrelated phrases are distant. Vector databases store these embeddings, supporting retrieval augmented generation by enabling the quick identification of relevant and similar content to answer users\\' queries effectively.\\n\\nAs companies integrate generative AI features within their SaaS offerings, they will increasingly leverage existing APIs and platforms to ground AI models using semantic search and vector databases.\\n\\nLeveraging Internet search results for AI grounding\\n\\nIn this case, a user\\'s request to the LLM is transformed into multiple internet search queries. The top results are then analyzed and fed back into the LLM through a subsequent prompt, providing context for the LLM to use. Before being presented to the user, the LLM\\'s output can be verified and cross-referenced with the search results.\\n\\nLet\\'s take a relatable example: researching treatment options for a health condition. Suppose a user asks the LLM to suggest different therapies for addressing a particular ailment. The system creates one or more search queries, performs a web search, and retrieves a list of web pages with information on various treatments. The AI model then parses the text from these web pages and incorporates it in the next prompt using in-context learning, which helps the LLM select relevant information based on the user\\'s original request. Finally, the model summarizes the results and facilitates a discussion with the user about the possible treatment options.\\n\\nIn this case, the actual web search results on treatment options act as grounding, using the search context to provide factual responses based on reliable and more up-to-date sources discovered in the search. Additionally, integrating citations and references from the web search results allows users to delve into the external data used for grounding, instilling confidence as they explore different healthcare options.\\n\\nUpdating model system messages and in-context examples\\n\\nEngineers can incorporate system messages to provide context that helps ground and align the model with user needs. Regularly updating the LLM\\'s internal system messages can keep the model informed about current trends and terminology, making its responses more relevant and accurate to users.\\n\\nFor instance, you could use a system message like, \"You are an expert nutritionist providing advice to health-conscious individuals, and all responses must be accurate and based on scientific research.\" This ensures more precise nutritional guidance in the model\\'s responses.\\n\\nRegularly updating an LLM\\'s internal system messages can keep the model informed about current trends and terminology, making its responses more relevant and accurate to users. In-context learning enables users to efficiently develop models for new scenarios like recognizing and responding to new slang terms or emerging health trends that gain popularity.\\n\\nBy providing a prompt composed of various input-output pairs, we can keep the AI model informed without adjusting and maintaining new parameters for each task. Ensuring that context is delivered through system messages and updating them regularly allows the AI model to generate responses that stay current and relevant to the user\\'s requirements, ultimately enhancing the overall user experience.\\n\\nProviding context and data sources\\n\\nSupplementing AI models with user-provided data sources, such as documents, significantly boosts their ability to understand context.\\n\\nFor instance, when summarizing a lengthy report, a more accurate and succinct summary can be achieved if the AI utilizes the document itself as context. Previously, models were limited by the maximum input tokens. However, the emergence of models like GPT-4 allows for substantially longer input contexts.\\n\\nOne effective method for grounding models is to enable users to provide documentation links for obtaining context. OpenAI\\'s GPT-4 launch demo illustrates this approach, where a developer received Python code from the model, based on specific requirements. After encountering an error message, the user supplied a link to the relevant technical documentation, allowing the model to deduce the appropriate bug fixes. As the context length increases and models access user/company-specific information, their output becomes more potent.\\n\\nMultimodal capabilities\\n\\nIntegrating multimodal features, such as visual input, can enrich an LLM\\'s contextual understanding when addressing inquiries. For instance, a user asking about an artwork\\'s style can provide its image along with the question, allowing the AI to analyze the picture and deliver a well-informed answer based on its assessment.\\n\\nAlthough it might not be a traditional form of grounding, modern multimodal models accepting text and images as prompts offer innovative ways to align with a user\\'s scope and context. Imagine a scenario where a user requests dinner recipe suggestions and provides a photo of the available pantry or fridge items.\\n\\nThe AI model can utilize image context to recommend recipes based on the ingredients at hand. In more advanced applications, users could request step-by-step repair instructions for an appliance or device while submitting images at each stage for the AI model to maintain context and provide accurate guidance.\\n\\nExpanding LLM capabilities by granting access to external tools\\n\\nAllowing an LLM to access external tools, such as calculators, can improve its accuracy when handling mathematical or computational questions.\\n\\nAn AI-driven digital assistant calculating long-term investment growth can utilize an external financial calculator to provide precise and contextually relevant results. Future models may have access to multiple external tools that can be used for verification, referencing, and grounding responses.\\n\\nCurrently, when an LLM is asked for driving directions, it provides turn-by-turn instructions based on its training dataset, which only includes up-to-date information up to a certain point. If the model could access and be trained to use external tools like real-time traffic data or personal user information through third-party APIs, its responses could factor in road closures, traffic conditions, and personalized requirements, such as electric charging stations.\\n\\nBenefits of grounding AI in enterprise applications\\n\\nBusinesses are constantly searching for technologies that set them apart from their competitors and offer them a decisive edge. Grounding AI has emerged as a differentiator that can enhance the AI model\\'s effectiveness and value in real-world applications.\\n\\nBy incorporating grounding techniques, AI-driven solutions can achieve more accurate, contextually relevant, and reliable results, paving the way for enterprises to gain a competitive advantage in today\\'s rapidly evolving market.\\n\\nHere are just a few of the ways grounding can benefit businesses:\\n\\nPersonalization: Grounded AI systems can tailor their responses and recommendations to individual users based on specific user data and unique requirements. This allows enterprises to deliver highly personalized customer experiences and cater to diverse client needs.\\n\\nCompliance: Many industries have strict regulations governing the use of data and decision-making processes. Enterprises can utilize grounding methods to ensure their AI systems adhere to these regulations by incorporating guidelines and policies directly into AI processes.\\n\\nReduced errors: By grounding AI models in real-world data and context, enterprises can minimize hallucinations that may arise from an AI system\\'s inability to process case-specific information. This ultimately improves overall system reliability and trustworthiness.\\n\\nScalability: Grounded AI systems can adapt to changes in context rapidly, allowing enterprises to scale AI deployments across various departments and use cases with ease.\\n\\nIndustry-specific insights: Grounding AI permits organizations to integrate industry-specific knowledge into AI systems, enhancing the model\\'s understanding and making the AI solution much more relevant and useful in the particular industry domain.\\n\\nReal-life case studies and applications of grounding\\n\\nGrounded AI has led to numerous practical advancements in various industries. By leveraging contextual information and real-world data, these AI systems offer significant improvements over traditional models. Below, we explore several case studies where grounding has been successfully applied.\\n\\nExample 1: Employee support with grounded conversational AI\\n\\nTools like Moveworks leverage company information, such as employee names, contact lists, meeting room titles, and software details, to make the AI\\'s responses more accurate. This approach leads to better support and helps enhance overall user satisfaction.\\n\\nExample 2: Medical diagnosis and treatment planning\\n\\nAI-assisted medical diagnosis tools benefit from additional patient-provided information. For example, while describing their symptoms to a doctor, patients can also share relevant medical history or lab results. This extra data helps doctors gain a deeper understanding of the patient\\'s condition, leading to more accurate diagnoses and better patient care.\\n\\nExample 3: Financial trading\\n\\nAI-powered financial trading tools can benefit from additional information from traders. For example, if a trader is making a decision about whether to buy or sell a stock, they can provide the AI tool with the company\\'s financial statements or the latest news about the company. This additional information helps the AI tool to make a more informed decision.\\n\\nExample 4: Education\\n\\nAI-powered educational tools can benefit from additional information from students. For example, if a student is working on a math problem, they can provide the AI tool with the steps they have already taken to solve the problem. This additional information helps the AI tool provide more helpful feedback.\\n\\nGrounding makes AI decision-making better.\\n\\nGrounding AI in real-world experiences elevates AI systems\\' capacity to become more efficient, context-aware, and adaptable to users\\' diverse needs. The importance of grounding AI cannot be overstated, as it bridges the gap between data-driven intelligence and human intuition, paving the way for more seamless and productive human-AI collaborations.\\n\\nTo harness the potential of grounded AI, further research and development are essential. Researchers, industries, and AI enthusiasts should continue to explore opportunities for integrating contextual data and real-world experiences in AI systems, unlocking their full capability and versatility.\\n\\nLarge language models are not one-size-fits-all.

Charged with managing a successful and high-performing company culture, HR professionals are experts at handling every stage of the employee lifecycle — from onboarding new hires to managing benefits to coaching leaders. Ensuring the success of thousands of employees is no easy task.\\n\\nThe real problem is that HR is responsible for so many manual tasks: whenever an employee needs help, the HR team has to do it by hand. The result is that HR spends tons of time on routine, repetitive tasks — rather than on meaningful interactions. And for employees, all this time waiting for answers slows their workday down. With this manual approach, global companies would never have a big enough HR team to keep up.\\n\\nFigure 1:\\xa0HR teams are responsible for every step of the employee lifecycle.\\n\\nAt Moveworks, we realized that the key to scaling the HR team is speed.\\n\\nIf you want employees to adopt new tools or fill out benefits, the right resources — from forms to knowledge articles — must be available to those who need them in seconds. And the only way to do this is to rethink the whole process from start to finish.\\n\\nFigure 2: With Moveworks, HR teams deliver real-time support at scale.\\n\\nThat’s why the Moveworks platform is purpose-built to handle HR issues: to help you create a culture of instant help at work. In building this solution, we found that three fundamental roadblocks hold back HR teams from making change happen overnight:\\n\\nEmployees don’t know where to go for HR support\\n\\nHR help needs to be personalized to each employee’s needs\\n\\nThe employee lifecycle is overwhelming to manage\\n\\nIn this blog, we’ll discuss how Moveworks is helping top HR teams deliver real-time support — at a massive scale.\\n\\nCreating a one-stop shop for support\\n\\nWhen employees have HR questions, they don’t know where to go. HR may have a system to submit issues to dedicated experts, but that doesn’t mean next steps are accessible or obvious. Employees aren’t thinking about complex backend reporting systems. They just want their questions answered. So the IT team is flooded with HR requests, the HR team gets finance questions, and the Finance team gets questions about IT issues.\\n\\nThat’s why we built a single starting point for employees to self-service their own support. On the front end, employees can ask any question in basic language. And on the back end, all the various support systems — from HR to IT — are integrated so that a single bot can answer every question.\\n\\nFigure 3:\\n\\nEmployees can submit any support issue to the Moveworks chatbot to get instant help.\\n\\nOur bot offers such a powerful experience because we’ve analyzed tens of millions of examples of how employees ask for help. By studying what these requests have in common, our machine learning models deeply understand everyday enterprise language. So we don’t have to predefine our bot’s actions. Instead, the bot autonomously works to discover the user’s underlying intent to give them the best response.\\n\\nBecause of this approach, we can easily transition from answering IT questions to helping employees in all spheres of their work-life, including HR. With every in-bot conversation, our models understand more, and employees learn through repetition that Moveworks is the first place to look for help.\\n\\nReaching the right expert in seconds\\n\\nIf an employee has a complex or sensitive issue, our AI-powered Smart Handoff transfers requests to the correct specialist, automatically and immediately. By either routing issues to the right HR professional or linking users to a specific process or workflow within the HR platform or Intranet site — employees get the support they need, and HR professionals get questions they’re specially qualified to answer.\\n\\nWith Moveworks, problems aren’t just solved faster — they’re solved automatically. So employees can get on with their work, and HR teams are free to personally handle more specialized tasks.\\n\\nFigure 4:\\n\\nWith Smart Handoff, employee questions get to the right department expert.\\n\\nDelivering personalized HR support automatically\\n\\nOne of the biggest challenges for HR is the constant trade-off between speed and precision. Conventional automation tools offer fast service, but they typically aren’t smart enough to provide the accurate response.\\n\\nConsider an employee requesting details on the employee referral program. Even to answer a simple question like this would be difficult to automate, given that the correct response depends on many factors — location, department, and seniority. You need to take all of these contextual details into account to surface the right knowledge.\\n\\nFigure 5: Moveworks uses context — location, role, seniority, department — to make every answer relevant.\\n\\nWe created a bot that’s specifically designed to take all of this disparate information into account and automatically solve issues. Autonomously curating an identity map for each employee — Moveworks provides tailor-made answers or redirects sensitive questions to the right expert.\\n\\nAs an HR team, it’s frustrating when the resources you’ve spent so much time building aren’t used. Setting up and personalizing the right answer manually can take forever. Our solution transforms company resources into an immediately helpful format, ensuring that employees get only the relevant snippet from a knowledge base article or the appropriate form that addresses their specific request.\\n\\nStreamlining the employee lifecycle\\n\\nCompany culture doesn't come down to only choosing the right benefits or enacting supportive policies. Company culture changes all the time, re-defining itself minute-to-minute. Onboarding, training, benefits enrollment, and career development are all opportunities for employees to know if their company is worth working at.\\n\\nNo HR team can operate at the kind of scale that modern enterprise requires. There’s so much to deal with that how you tackle every challenge matters. And that’s why having a strategy that incorporates machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) is critical, given these technologies’ ability to resolve thousands of issues simultaneously.\\n\\nFigure 6:\\n\\nWith Moveworks, HR teams can send targeted messages to employees.\\n\\nRight now, communicating at each of these critical moments is time-intensive and manual. It’s time to incorporate real-time automation that can target the right employees at the right time, so no one tunes you out.\\n\\nWith our solution, you can move away from the slow, manual email communication model and instead target specific employees with actionable messages. By automating internal communication, HR teams are free to focus on these bigger, more strategic projects that take time and human creativity to implement.\\n\\nRedefining your digital HQ\\n\\nIn this digital era, companies blend together, all using the same SaaS tools. Our customers — like Palo Alto Networks — know that standing out comes down to the little things, like providing support the moment it’s needed. And that means investing in a digital workplace, just as much as a physical office.\\n\\n“It’s really the small moments that create your company culture,” said Elizabeth Wheeler, Senior Manager of Benefits & HR Connect at Palo Alto Networks. “With Moveworks, we’ve made those millions of small moments effortless — by giving our employees what they need, when they need it. The result is that my team can focus on the big projects that move our business forward.”\\n\\nWith AI, there’s a fantastic opportunity to create an experience that’s distinctive to your organization. When we founded Moveworks, we shared a vision to empower employees worldwide to focus on the most impactful work. Extending our abilities to HR is just the beginning. HR teams handle an impossible workload, but with Moveworks for HR, these highly-engaged professionals can keep up with the modern workplace’s constantly evolving demands.\\n\\nContact us to learn how you can use Moveworks to automate HR support.\\n\\ntechnology\\n\\nMore blog posts\\n\\nHow to unlock continual service improvement with AIOps\\n      \\n        \\n          Discover how AIOps transforms IT operations from reactive to proactive.

Forrester recognizes Moveworks as among the top vendors evaluated.\\n\\nManaging all elements of virtual agents, from implementation to language refinement, Moveworks’ strategy is to take on the hard parts of making virtual agents useful.”\\n\\nWhat we believe sets Moveworks apart is our unique approach to support. Rather than simply tracking issues or providing recommendations, Moveworks resolves those issues end-to-end — completely autonomously — by connecting a company’s entire support ecosystem and making it easy for everyone to get the help they need.\\n\\nWith regard to Forrester’s 33 specific criteria, which are scored on a scale of 0 (weak) to 5 (strong), Moveworks received the highest score possible in 19 such criteria, including: chatbot readiness, product vision, execution roadmap, market approach, supporting products and services, and category revenue.\\n\\nHere’s what Forrester’s findings mean for our customers:\\n\\nRapid time-to-value\\n\\nFor companies looking to automate IT support with a chatbot, the first consideration is time-to-value: how long it takes to get results. Conventional chatbot toolkits require IT teams to manually build scripts and dialog flows over the course of several months — then continue to adjust those workflows as the IT environment evolves. This manual approach to building a chatbot simply cannot scale.\\n\\nWhat does it mean to have a high score for “chatbot readiness”? By leveraging a combination of advanced conversational AI and natural language understanding (NLU), Moveworks starts resolving IT issues out of the box, without any training or scripting for the customer.\\n\\nThe Forrester report states that “managing all elements of virtual agents, from implementation to language refinement, Moveworks’ strategy is to take on the hard parts of making virtual agents useful” which allows IT teams to dramatically accelerate the bot’s deployment and impact.\\n\\nWe wanted AI-powered solutions to take root in our org, but we didn’t realize how fast it could happen. Moveworks blew us away right out of the gate. We started with simple automation, but now we’re automatically provisioning software, sending targeted communications, and freeing up hands to work on higher-level projects.”\\n\\n— David Kaczerski, Director of Global ServiceDesk, Hearst\\n\\nAI that is easy to adopt\\n\\nFor a chatbot to effectively resolve employees’ support issues, it needs powerful tech behind it. The Moveworks Platform has a powerful, sophisticated natural language understanding (NLU) engine trained on 400+ million support issues that recognizes 99 percent of enterprise support requests out of the box.\\n\\nWe also understand that our customers’ support ecosystems change over time, so we built Moveworks to evolve\\xa0with them. Moveworks uses Collective Learning’s network effect to understand complex requests and identify new entities and resources as they are added or changed. This means our chatbot constantly improves its performance and enterprise language comprehension. No matter how employees describe their problems or which language they use, our bot gets the message.\\n\\n“Moveworks is this simple, magical UI that talks to users and gets them answers right away, and connects to the complex backend systems that users don’t need to experience.”\\n\\nStitch Fix\\n\\nConnecting the entire support ecosystem\\n\\nThe purpose of an IT chatbot is to provide a single interface for employees to resolve all support issues, from requesting software to resetting passwords to finding the right knowledge article.\\n\\nWith this goal in mind, Moveworks has created deep integrations with dozens of enterprise systems — and we’re excited that Forrester gave us the highest score possible in the omnichannel support criterion, part of the chatbot language and learning capabilities criterion. Our platform takes autonomous action within these systems, allowing employees to self-service their IT issues directly through the bot.\\n\\nMoveworks lets us up-level people. We’re not talking about resetting passwords and solving tickets anymore — we’re automating things and focusing on transformation.”\\n\\nNicole Tate-Pappas, Senior Director of Experience, Palo Alto Networks\\n\\nValidating the Moveworks vision\\n\\nWhen we founded Moveworks in 2016, we shared a single vision: empower employees around the world to focus on impactful work. We’ve spent the last six years building an AI chatbot that resolves employees’ tech issues — instantly and autonomously — to make that vision a reality.\\n\\nSo while the Forrester report gave Moveworks the highest possible scores (5 out of 5) in 19 total criteria, we’re most excited about our 5 out of 5 scores in the product vision and execution roadmap criteria. Our chatbot has already transformed the support process for customers like DocuSign, Albemarle, and Broadcom. But despite what we’ve accomplished, and despite this recognition from Forrester, we know the best is yet to come.\\n\\nDownload The Forrester Wave™: Chatbots for IT Operations, Q4 2022 here.\\n\\nContact  Moveworks to learn how AI can supercharge your workforce's productivity.\\n\\nnews\\n\\nMore blog posts\\n\\nHow to unlock continual service improvement with AIOps\\n      \\n        \\n          Discover how AIOps transforms IT operations from reactive to proactive.

Already, European companies across industries rely on Moveworks to deliver a world-class employee experience, and we’re only getting started.\\n\\nI’d like to thank the thousands of leaders in North America who believe in our vision — leaders who refuse to settle for the status quo when it comes to truly supporting their people. Our customers at companies like Palo Alto Networks, DocuSign, and Verisk decided that getting help at work should take seconds, and so they invested in a conversational AI platform that often wasn’t in the business plan, because they knew it would solve a huge business problem. They made this milestone a reality.\\n\\nThe truth is that employee experience will make or break every business in Europe, since flexible work opens up job opportunities anywhere on Earth. Now, you can simply log out of your current company and log in to another, which means you won’t tolerate waiting three days to get IT support, or having no idea where to go for HR help, or enrolling in the wrong healthcare policy because you missed a mass email. Moveworks is ready to meet the demand for our platform in Europe, and enable customers like Premier Foods to meet employees’ expectations:\\n\\n\"Our employees expect a seamless experience, which is why we\\'re thrilled to be on this journey with Moveworks. We look forward to giving our colleagues immediate support in Microsoft Teams, where they already spend their digital day, just by asking the Moveworks bot.

At Moveworks, we take this statement as fact. It’s why we’ve spent years engineering an extensive network of machine learning models to take complex processes, like IT support and HR service delivery, and automate them end-to-end.\\n\\nWe also know that to deliver a best-in-class employee experience in today's inter-connected world, our platform can’t stop at just solving issues; it has to proactively prevent them from happening in the first place. But trying to predict the future, especially when every company has its own behind-the-scenes challenges, can be maddening — which is where our first API comes in.\\n\\nMoveworks’ new Message API allows companies to pull critical information from across their support environment so support teams aren’t caught off guard by unexpected issues. Already, customers, including companies like Broadcom and Nutanix have used our API to automatically send targeted messages, critical updates, and actionable requests — stopping their workforce from getting bogged down by preventable problems.\\n\\nMore to the point, the potential use cases for our API are limited to your imagination. You can automate disk cleanup, remove unauthorized software, reclaim unused devices, backup disks, run surveys, manage approvals, e-sign requests, and send reminders or expense updates — needless to say, the list goes on. For today, I’ll just give you a taste of what’s possible, running through 4 of the most transformative Message API use cases we’ve seen so far:\\n\\nReclaim unused software licenses at scale\\n\\nIT teams manually manage hundreds of applications, but less than half are regularly used by employees. Message API works with systems like Okta, Productiv, Active Directory, and SailPoint to seamlessly pass data to and from each of these many SaaS applications, auto-updating access permissions in seconds.\\n\\nThe result? Companies save millions of dollars on tech that would otherwise just sit unused, without disrupting employees’ workdays.\\n\\nFigure 1: Automatically managing software licenses saves your team time and money.\\n\\nProactively resolve device issues\\n\\nMessage API keeps employees on task by preventing common hardware issues from spinning out of control. If an employee is running out of disk space or has unauthorized software on their machine, our chatbot acts as a conduit, pulling critical information from tools like Nexthink to alert that user of potential issues.\\n\\nOn cue, Moveworks’ conversational AI steps in, giving that employee a space to ask follow-up questions, while offering actionable next steps to fix the problem, before anyone has to suffer the consequences of a faulty device.\\n\\nFigure 2:\\n\\nKeep employees productive by sending action-oriented messages in response to real-time hardware issues.\\n\\nOnboard employees in days, not months\\n\\nMessage API eases new hires into everyday life, helping them feel like they're at home within a week, not a month. Integrating with standard tools such as Workday, Okta, Postman, and Zapier, our API takes the pressure off support teams’ by automatically providing new employees with access to all of the apps, accounts, paperwork, and systems they need to start their job right.\\n\\nOnboarding with Moveworks means that employees don’t have to figure out company-specific jargon to get to work. All the software, forms, policies, and day one resources they need are already at their fingertips directly in chat.\\n\\nFigure 3: Set the stage for your new hires’ success by giving them everything they need in a single place.\\n\\nDeliver critical updates automatically\\n\\nAutomate your entire incident workflow with Message API. Detecting issues as they happen with tools like Splunk, Salesforce, and ServiceNow, your bot is empowered to send out comms automatically notifying your workforce of outages, disruptive incidents, and security breaches, and to answer the questions on the tip of your employees’ tongues.\\n\\nWhether the WiFi’s out or there’s a security breach, it’s critical for your response team to kick into action, your employees to quickly learn workarounds, and stakeholders to know when things will resume. Message API allows you to do deliver messages dynamically, ensuring that everyone has the resources they need to quickly adjust to changing circumstances\\n\\nFigure 4: Prevent long support queues by sending employees timely, interactive comms.\\n\\nThe tech it takes to stop issues in their tracks\\n\\nWe often ask ourselves here at Moveworks: What does it take to get ahead of problems at work? There’s a litany of things happening across a company at any given time. New employees are hired. Old software is retired. New policies are launched. The office WiFi goes out.\\n\\nAn API is only part of what it takes to manage all this chaos. It also takes everything else that Moveworks can do, from deeply understanding support issues to transforming resources into intelligible solutions.\\n\\nWe’ve found there’s a huge appetite for an API from our customers who want to extend the power of Moveworks, incorporating our conversational AI platform into any system in minutes. Because we don’t expect your support teams to become machine learning experts, we’ll always provide the same fully autonomous support from day one — without training, scripting, or maintenance from you.\\n\\nMessage API makes Moveworks smarter, allowing teams to create workflows automatically, helping every employee get the information and support they need — before they run into problems.\\n\\nStart building with the Moveworks API — today.\\n\\nnews\\n\\nproduct features\\n\\nemployee experience\\n\\nMore blog posts\\n\\nHow to unlock continual service improvement with AIOps\\n      \\n        \\n          Discover how AIOps transforms IT operations from reactive to proactive.

They don’t just sell a more efficient, more effective product. They sell a belief about how the world should be — a belief that begins inside the organization itself.\\n\\nThat’s why category creators don’t succeed simply by engineering the best product, acquiring the best customers, or building the best brand. Rather, I\\'ve realized that creating a category means focusing first and foremost on our people. It’s people who deliver the product, the customers, and the brand, so step one is to empower the right people with the right company culture. To change the world, you need a world-class workplace.\\n\\nHere’s the problem: there are about 1 billion search results on Google for the query “company culture advice,” offering an almost endless selection of conflicting opinions. Especially for startups outside an established industry, pinpointing your unique company culture can feel like throwing darts — with trial and error until something sticks. However, while every business is different, I’d like to save you some time by suggesting these three universal principles for category creators:\\n\\nEmbody your belief\\n\\nPractice collaborative ownership\\n\\nBe totally\\xa0transparent\\n\\nBut first, let me answer your burning question: What do we know, anyway?\\n\\nWhat we know\\n\\nFor the last five years, we’ve watched a new category of employee support emerge. Employee support has been reimagined with the idea of helping companies keep their people productive — from IT to HR service delivery to policy information — by using artificial intelligence to make the employee experience effortless. More than 100 enterprise customers share our vision for employee experience, including fellow category creators like DocuSign, Stitch Fix, and LinkedIn.\\n\\nThe last few weeks in particular were among the most rewarding of my career. Allow me one paragraph of shameless self-promotion, if only to convince you that there\\'s a method to our madness:\\n\\nForbes AI 50 — the definitive list of the most promising AI companies — for the third consecutive time. We then earned two 2021 American Business Awards\\n\\n®, including Silver for\\n\\nMost Innovative Tech Company of the Year. But my favorite news came this week. On May 7, the\\n\\nBest Places to Work in the Bay Area, and yesterday, on May 12, we were included on\\n\\nBest Workplaces of 2021.\\n\\nThe company culture awards weren’t just my favorite because I lead People Operations. They’re my favorite because, without our unique culture, we couldn’t have built our technology in the first place.\\n\\nLet me explain.\\n\\nPrinciple #1: Embody your belief\\n\\nFor your employees to become champions of your category, their own workdays must embody your belief about the world.\\n\\nAt a glance, this principle seems straightforward. Gatorade’s employees probably aren’t drinking apple juice all day. Uber’s team likely doesn’t take the bus to work. And DocuSign’s office won’t ever get cluttered by thousands of paper contracts.\\n\\nYet perfect harmony between your culture and your belief is deeper than using your own product — although that’s a great place to start. Instead, the key is to ask yourself, before every decision you make, whether that decision reflects the company belief. There’s a reason this is my first principle. Employees are quick to spot the difference between a consistent, genuine conviction and an inconsistent, half-hearted mantra on a poster.\\n\\nI’ll use Moveworks as an example. We believe that companies thrive when their employees can spend as much time as possible on high-impact work. Of course, our belief manifests in our product itself: an AI platform that eliminates busywork by automatically resolving IT, HR, finance, and facilities issues. But if we failed to internalize our belief — if life at Moveworks was, in fact, full of friction and anxiety — we would never have gotten off the ground.\\n\\nSo how do we embody our belief? Above all, we’re committed to simplifying the workday, which is the opposite of what naturally happens when fast-growing companies add new tools, systems, and processes. When we decide to invest in software, for instance, it’s always to reduce complexity for employees. This commitment often results in additional costs, or custom workflows for every department, or extra effort during implementation. Making things easy is hard. And yet, if it means we live up to our belief, it’s worth it.\\n\\nMost importantly, your belief should inform how you treat your employees, not only inside but also outside the office. At Moveworks, we recognize that friction and anxiety come from our personal lives as well, particularly in a global health crisis. To that end, we give our employees everything they need to concentrate on their work. When they get sick, they get access to comprehensive healthcare — with no insurance premiums. When they have a baby, we offer 100% paid parental leave, in excess of state requirements. And when they retire, our 401(k) matching program ensures their peace of mind.\\n\\nWe provide these benefits for three reasons:\\n\\nWe care about our colleagues\\n\\nPrioritizing our people over cutting costs will pay off in the long run\\n\\nIt reinforces our belief about allowing employees to focus on what matters\\n\\nWhatever category you create, my advice is to make it real inside your workplace, before you go to market. There’s no shortage of support for this principle, whether you prefer famous TED talks on the value of finding your “why,\" or quantitative proof that people are more loyal to purpose-driven brands. But the true test is common sense. If your own employees can’t passionately champion your belief, how can you expect prospective customers to just “get it” after one demo?\\n\\nPrinciple #2: Practice collaborative ownership\\n\\nCategory creators let talented people take ownership over their functions, while still maintaining constant communication across the company.\\n\\nCategory creators must strike a careful balance between team collaboration and individual ownership. Successful category creators make this balance work to their advantage.\\n\\nFirst, let’s analyze each term. The merits of collaboration are clear — teamwork is the foundation of every company on earth. For category creators, though, preventing silos of information and feedback is even more critical, since employees can’t depend on experience alone to understand the broader business. If working at a normal organization with silos is like flying an airplane by yourself, then working at a category creator with silos is like single-handedly operating an alien spaceship.\\n\\nTo avoid crashing that spaceship, your sales team must develop a close relationship with your product team, which can walk through new, often unprecedented features. Your engineering team should, in turn, meet regularly with your sales team to gauge demand from customers — the only way for them to know what projects to prioritize. And your marketing team needs to stay up to speed with all of those engineering projects, or your messaging will drift further and further away from your real features. Creating a category means mastering collaboration.\\n\\nSo, you ask, why the emphasis on individual ownership? In short, because there’s no other option. At Moveworks, we’ve built the first platform that solves every support issue, for every employee, no matter what they want, using a combination of natural language understanding (NLU), conversational AI, and probabilistic machine learning. There isn’t a user manual in the spaceship’s glovebox detailing how to fix our platform. Or measure its efficacy. Or talk about it on social media. Ultimately, each employee becomes the leading experts on their function: what fuels the ship, what crashes the ship, and why.\\n\\nWithout a manual to follow, category creation simply can’t happen under a strict corporate hierarchy, with orders passed down from above. Autonomy allows your team to thrive as a collective. But to accomplish your end goal — to write your own spaceship user manual one day — it requires over-communicating the insights you uncover. What are customers saying? What are analysts saying? What are your Twitter followers saying? Across the board, collaborative ownership gives your expert employees the knowledge necessary to reach new heights.\\n\\nPrinciple #3: Be totally\\xa0transparent\\n\\nCategory creation is a massive undertaking for every single employee, which is why they need — and deserve — total visibility over the business.\\n\\nAbout 90% of startups fail. And without exception, 100% of startups pursue a bad idea, or fail to capitalize on a good idea, at some point. The lesson? Being wrong means you’re on the right path. Taking risks is the only safe bet. Unless you’re transparent, however, your employees can’t learn from mistakes, determine necessary risks, nor see the bigger picture.\\n\\nAs you might’ve expected by now, the need for full transparency is even greater when creating a category. From a financial standpoint, most of your employees won’t know how your business is performing — much less be able to benchmark that performance, given the lack of peer group companies — without access to sales figures and context. From a technology perspective, your people can’t allocate their efforts appropriately until they have a sense of what’s selling and what’s not. In short, you’re on the spaceship together, so don’t hide the dashboard.\\n\\nReturning to the Moveworks example, our leaders practice and preach transparency across all workstreams. At our weekly all-hands meeting, engineers discuss their latest achievements in detail — but with humor and analogies rather than technical jargon. Our CEO shares takeaways from every discussion with our board, including granular company financials and expansion plans. Furthermore, all four of our co-founders keep their calendars open and public for anyone who wants to book time. This transparency and collective strategizing provides everyone the context to inform smart decisions.\\n\\nBeyond the tangible value of transparency for decision-making, there’s also an intangible benefit that’s just as important: a culture of ownership. Creating a category is among the most difficult and most rewarding challenges in the business world, one that demands a constant, unwavering commitment from your entire workforce. If your employees believe what you believe, they’re working for more than a paycheck; they’re working to turn your belief into reality. I’d argue they deserve to be treated as owners, and therefore, as leaders.\\n\\nPeople first\\n\\nNeedless to say, creating a new category takes a compelling, if not revolutionary product. Perhaps that explains why, especially in Silicon Valley, we assume that category creators should have engineering-first or product-first cultures.\\n\\nI disagree. Category creators aren’t engineering-first companies. Nor are they product-first companies. They are people-first companies. Your people write the code, deliver the product, serve the customers, and build the brand. If you hire the right people and establish the right company culture, the rest will follow.\\n\\nSo embody your belief.\\n\\nPractice collaborative ownership.\\n\\nBe totally\\xa0transparent.\\n\\nAnd go build something that’s never been built before.\\n\\nCheck out our Careers to help us transform the world of employee support.\\n\\nWant to learn more?\\n\\nWorking at Moveworks means working alongside a team of winners - making an impact, every day.

We set ourselves a very high bar for issue resolution times, and we’re always trying to move the needle on service accessibility.\\n\\n1.Bot handles a growing share of issues\\n\\nIn our first week with the bot, we were excited to see it resolve about 8% of our employees’ IT support issues. After an implementation taking just a few weeks, it was great to see value straight out of the gate. Today 1.Bot is consistently resolving 38-40% of issues every week. It’s getting so effective that pretty soon we plan to turn off our telephone-based support for L1 issues. The most impressive part about this is that our journey to 40% happened without hiring any additional staff. We don’t have any admins for Moveworks, no coders, nobody writing workflows of conversation scripts, no machine learning experts. We just keep an eye on the new features that frequently become available in the bot so we can make sure our employees hear about those and start using them right away.\\n\\nThe journey\\n\\nOur journey actually started about three years ago when we began looking for an AI platform that could take over as the first line of IT support for employees. It was a frustrating search. Almost every solution we looked at required us to write scripts, build dialogs, or train machine learning models. So it was a breath of fresh air when we found Moveworks. They understood that the value of an AI chatbot is all about the learning. It’s all about how it learns to understand what employees are asking for, and solve their problems automatically. Learning is different from teaching or training. We didn’t want to have a system we had to teach or train — we wanted something that could continually learn, all on its own.\\n\\nLearning to chat with employees\\n\\nWhen you handle IT support, the sheer variety of questions you get is huge — almost infinite. As an IT team, we can\\'t anticipate all the things employees will ask about, or how they will ask for it. Additionally, our IT environment is constantly changing — new apps or services can be introduced at any time. For this reason, having Moveworks handle the natural language understanding is essential. The Moveworks service learns constantly from its conversations with employees and from the contents of IT tickets. This is true machine learning. My team doesn\\'t have to teach the bot anything.\\n\\nAnticipating what employees want\\n\\nSo what have we focused on to make the bot more effective? Well, another key benefit of having Moveworks underpinning our IT support process is that Moveworks provides us with a very clear roadmap of changes that we can make to unlock more autonomous resolution. Sometimes this means writing new knowledge articles, or enabling a new app to be provisioned through Okta, or building more automation in something like Workato. Or course, we used to do all this before, but oftentimes this work would sit idle — Moveworks brings all of this to life by making it accessible through a bot. The employee doesn’t have to know what the new automation or article is called, or even know it exists — they just talk to the bot and it finds the right answer or triggers the automation immediately.\\n\\nThis easy accessibility is a big accelerator during onboarding. Given the size of our organization and the acquisitions we do, we sometimes need to bring thousands of employees into the company in a single day, without increasing the size of our IT team, and 1.Bot lets us do this. On the back end, we\\'d built the automation in Okta and Workday to enable this, but imagine directing a new-hire — or a thousand of them — to a bunch of complicated onboarding tools. Now this problem is gone. We just say, \"Go to 1.Bot!\", and they get everything they need: the bot answers their questions, gets them the applications they need, and sets them up on the right email lists, and so on. It\\'s real one-stop shopping for new employees, and they love it.\\n\\nDelivering what employees want\\n\\nMoveworks is constantly releasing new skills for the platform. As an early adopter of Moveworks we like to have early access to these new skills and to participate in evolving the capabilities of the platform. This is a big deal for us, because Moveworks is building out skills based on machine learning they do across many organizations. If our IT team had to develop 1.Bot’s new skills ourselves, we\\'d first have to anticipate every new use case our employees would need help with, then predict how they were going to ask for it, and then attempt to design conversation flows, integrations, and business logic. We\\'re an IT support team, not a linguistics team or AI team.\\n\\n1.Bot’s year in review\\n\\nWe have big goals and expectations for the next 12 months, but here’s a quick summary of what we’ve achieved in year one:\\n\\n38% of IT tickets resolved automatically\\n\\n6,000 tickets per month resolved\\n\\n72,785 tickets triaged to the right assignment group\\n\\nOver 10,000 employee information lookups (roles, contact details, and so on)\\n\\nOver 19,000 ticket status checks\\n\\nIf I could highlight the top five impacts Moveworks has had on our IT service delivery, they would be\\n\\nBetter employee experience. Issues get resolved in seconds, regardless of the employee’s time zone.\\n\\nPainless onboarding. During big acquisitions, we’ve brought on thousands of people in a day with minimal disruption.\\n\\nVirtually zero admin cost. All we really need to do is stay on top of new features, and Moveworks even helps us promote the bot’s new capabilities.\\n\\nGets smarter on its own. We don’t have to teach the bot, it learns constantly.\\n\\nGives us a roadmap. 1.Bot hears what employees are asking for. If the solution they’re looking for is missing, we know right away and can add it.\\n\\nOverall, it’s been an amazing journey. For a long time, the reality of AI has failed to live up to the hype. But in our first year with Moveworks we have proven that AI is finally able to transform the way we deliver IT support. Not just incrementally, but radically. We are excited to see what happens in year two.\\n\\nInterested in learning more?\\n\\nTo learn more about how our customers are using Moveworks, take a look at our case studies:\\n\\nBroadcom takes on new challenges and new employees, helped by a new AI solution\\n\\nAutodesk HelpBot: Quick answers bring quick adoption\\n\\nNutanix gets rapid results using AI for IT support\\n\\ncustomer\\n\\nonboarding\\n\\nchatbot\\n\\nkb\\n\\nresolution\\n\\nGoogle-Hangouts\\n\\ncustomer stories\\n\\nMore blog posts\\n\\nHow to unlock continual service improvement with AIOps\\n      \\n        \\n          Discover how AIOps transforms IT operations from reactive to proactive.

This new capability was developed with input from Slack, and it\\'s already live at several Moveworks customers.\\n\\nFounded in 2016 by artificial intelligence experts from Facebook, Google, and Stanford University, Moveworks uses cutting-edge AI to resolve employee support issues autonomously. Existing capabilities enabled the conversational AI to engage with employees through direct messages, respond to issues submitted via email, and proactively offer assistance to employees based on system alerts. The new Channel Resolver now allows Moveworks to identify more opportunities to help employees based on posts in public Slack channels.\\n\\n\"Enterprise chat has become central to enterprise communication, and public channels in platforms like Slack enable support teams to provide more transparency and collaboration around support activities. But conversational AI and NLU powered bots have struggled to cope with the complexity of channels, focusing instead on direct messages as the preferred communication method,\" said Bhavin Shah, CEO and co-founder, Moveworks. \"This is because chat channels are longer, more complex, and more noisy. Many IT teams also develop unique interaction methods in channels; for example, using emoticons as a way to signal that a request is being \\'watched\\' or has been \\'resolved.\\' To deal with this complexity, our team had to evolve our natural language understanding capabilities for these group social settings and interactions models. The result is Channel Resolver, which enables the Moveworks bot to step in, provide help when it can, and communicate in a channel the same way a support agent would.\"\\n\\nWith the increased popularity of chat platforms, it is a common practice at companies to ask users to submit their IT issues in a shared channel, where agents monitor the incoming messages and respond within threads. This practice allows the channel to serve as a \"queue\" from which agents can pick up new IT issues, and allows the sharing of answers to IT issues among employees. In theory, this prevents agents from having to answer repetitive questions, as users can \"self-serve\" from answers available within the channel before asking a new question. But the reality is that service desk agents answer many of the same questions over and over again, and it still requires significant effort to review and answer issues.\\n\\nChannel Resolver enhances Moveworks\\' ability to provide autonomous IT support across all available IT support channels. Today\\'s launch of Channel Resolver provides greater access to an organization\\'s IT Help Desk without having to implement a labor-intensive, process-heavy system to manage and monitor all the available support channels. In addition to Channel Resolver, the Moveworks AI platform already allows IT users to autonomously resolve IT issues by using the following:\\n\\nConversation Resolver: allows end users to engage with the Moveworks bot in a Direct Message within the chat environment for instant resolution.\\n\\nTicket Resolver: allows end users to seek help by emailing IT or submitting tickets through the Self Service Portal. The Moveworks platform will read incoming tickets and proactively reach out to users in a direct message for instant resolution, where appropriate.\\n\\nEvent Resolver: The Moveworks platform monitors for key events within customers enterprise systems and proactively contacts users in a direct message when a specific event or trigger is identified, instantly resolving or mitigating potential IT issues.\\n\\nMedia Contact\\n\\nSophia Xepoleas, Sr PR Manager\\n\\nEmail:\\n\\npr@moveworks.ai\\n\\nWeb:\\n\\nMoveworks.com/contact\\n\\nSolutions\\n\\nCustomers\\n\\nResources\\n\\nBlog\\n\\nSitemap\\n\\nPlatform\\n\\nPlatform overview\\n\\nMoveworks API\\n\\nSystem status\\n\\nCompany\\n\\nAbout us\\n\\nNewsroom\\n\\nContact us\\n\\nCareers\\n\\n©2023 Moveworks, Inc.\\n\\nPrivacy policies', metadata={'source': 'https://www.moveworks.com/press-releases/2020/02/moveworks-launches-channel-resolver-to-accelerate-resolution-of-employee-it-issues'}),\n",

But — whether you lead HR, IT, or another department responsible for the employee experience — it falls on you to decide if an idea is feasible, let alone if it should be prioritized. So how can you possibly take input from potentially thousands of people across your organization and figure out what to do next?\\n\\nI’ve been thinking about this overwhelming challenge ever since I watched Alex Henson, our VP of Marketing, interview Nelm Khangura, VP of Store and Colleague Solutions at Loblaw, in an episode of our podcast, Legends of Employee Experience. To survive in today’s fast-paced, complex business world, leaders must continuously refine how they make decisions to ensure they stay on the right path. That’s why the decision-making framework she uses — the Idea Funnel — caught my attention.\\n\\nWorking cross-functionally at one of the biggest companies in Canada means Nelm’s had to sift through loads of different tools to find the most meaningful initiatives to transform the employee experience. When it comes down to choosing the right ones to pursue, she depends on the Idea Funnel.\\n\\nWhat is the Idea Funnel?\\n\\nSimply put, the Idea Funnel is a method for taking a mountain of ideas and turning them into a handful of impactful initiatives. It’s a framework for making sure you’re only investing your time and resources in the best ideas — ones that will make an impact.\\n\\nRemember the last time you conducted a brainstorming session or an employee survey. By the end of it, you were probably drowning in competing thoughts and opinions, unsure of where to go next. Some ideas may have sounded simple, like improving the HQ’s WiFi connection. While others might have seemed more outrageous, like implementing a\\xa0 4-day workweek.\\n\\nTo redefine what it means to have a great workplace, you need to sit down and sort through tens, hundreds, or even thousands of comments to decide which ones are realistic. Then, you need to prioritize those comments based on feasibility. But how? Enter the Idea Funnel. With this framework, you can sift through a plethora of ideas so that you’re left with only the very best by the time you're finished.\\n\\nThe five steps of developing your Idea Funnel\\n\\nAs an employee experience leader, here are five steps you can take to strategically prioritize the right programs and make a career-defining impact:\\n\\n1. Gather ideas from across all relevant departments, teams, and individuals.\\n\\nGood ideas can come from everywhere. Don’t discount those that come from unpredictable places. And remember, what you think is a pain point might be entirely different for those who experience it daily. To understand why the status quo isn’t working, you need to ask around before you make any changes.\\n\\n2. Determine how to measure the business impact of your ideas.\\n\\nOnce you understand the problem, you can establish consistent criteria to evaluate every idea that enters your funnel. You must know what success is to decide what kind of solution you need.\\n\\n3. Screen your ideas.\\n\\nUsing the pre-defined criteria, walk ideas through the funnel. Some that sounded initially promising might not survive, while seemingly ridiculous ideas might pass muster. By the time you reach the bottom of the funnel, you’ll have a handful of options that match your original goals.\\n\\n4. Conduct a proof of concept on all viable ideas.\\n\\nFor all the remaining ideas, give them a final sanity check. Outline how they would work in practice and determine a plan for allocating resources moving forward. This stage is all about preparing the idea for the real world. If something is simply not practical, you’ll quickly find out before committing additional resources.\\n\\n5. Start a pilot program for the ideas that survived the POC stage.\\n\\nOnly the best ideas make it to this stage. Now is the time to create a minimum viable product and measure progress — or lack thereof — at regular intervals. If everything goes well, you can fully launch the idea to a larger audience. Maybe it turns out that investing in nap pods or speeding up IT support is where you should invest your time and energy. You won’t be guessing — you’ll know you made the right choice.\\n\\nMake the right decisions with the Idea Funnel\\n\\nAt first glance, deciding what to do next doesn’t look hard. Get your hands on a lot of ideas. Throw away the wrong ones. Choose the right ones. Celebrate your success.\\n\\nBut that’s not the case, is it? Every decision is the biggest decision in your career. Every choice you make ultimately determines whether a new initiative succeeds or fails. That’s not table stakes. You need a plan.\\n\\nThis framework helps leaders like Nelm structure the chaos of innovation and carefully select only the best, most effective ideas.

But making those changes — whether you're switching CRMs, returning to the office, or rolling out new software — requires massive coordination.\\n\\nThat's why communication is at the heart of every company. To manage change, you need your employees to be up-to-date, no matter where they're physically working. Informed employees stay productive and avoid problems proactively — reducing the workload for your support teams.\\n\\nFigure 1: Typical mass communication approaches, like emails, are often left unread by employees — making it difficult to keep priorities aligned company-wide.\\n\\nNow the bad news: traditional employee communications are no longer effective. Employees are experts at tuning out irrelevant information, so if even a single email isn’t important, they learn to ignore that sender completely. And seeing how our customers' employees were already accustomed to using Moveworks as a one-stop shop for help, we decided to build a solution that tackles the challenge of keeping your organization in sync and moving forward with purpose.\\n\\nWe’re thrilled to officially announce that Moveworks for Employee Communications is available for everyone:\\n\\nFigure 2: With Moveworks for Employee Communications, company leaders can send actionable messages to precisely the right people.\\n\\nThis blog will walk through how industry leaders like Autodesk,\\xa0Robert Half, and Vituity use Moveworks to make change happen overnight. We’ll cover how our Employee Comms solution:\\n\\nSends targeted messages to only the right employees\\n\\nEnsures those employees take immediate action\\n\\nAnswers follow-up questions in real time\\n\\nStop getting ignored.\\n\\nEmployees are flooded with hundreds of emails a day. So when it comes to catching a certain team or person’s attention, today’s companies face an enormous challenge. On the one hand, they need to keep everyone on the same page when policies change or tools are updated. And on the other hand, they have to ensure that this downpour of information trickles into only the right inboxes.\\n\\nThis was the challenge that inspired us to build a way to easily send messages to just the right employees. Thanks to our identity system, when you plan a campaign with our Communications Console, you can factor in everything from seniority and department to role and security permissions when selecting the audience for your message. And by automatically taking employee location and time zone into account, we help you deliver messages at the right time to boost engagement even further.\\n\\nFigure 3:\\n\\nWith Moveworks, targeting the right audience is as easy as filtering employees by demographic, from job title to location.\\n\\nTypically, the more messages you send, the more you’re ignored. But with Moveworks — it’s just the opposite. Since every message is meaningful, every one reinforces the idea that our chatbot is the place to go for consistently high-quality information. In fact, by sending targeted campaigns, our early adopters have seen engagement rates as high as 72%.\\n\\nOn top of this, you’re freed up to communicate what you want whenever you want. Because you know that you're going only to reach the right people, you no longer have to worry about overwhelming anyone with irrelevant information.\\n\\nActions speak louder than words.\\n\\nThe goal of most internal comms is to get employees to complete a task. And this means reaching out to them where they spend most of their time: chat.\\n\\nChat is the way to do employee comms. Workers spend their entire day on Teams, Slack, or other enterprise messaging apps. When it comes to getting the whole company to enroll in new healthcare benefits or complete mandatory security training — chat is a natural jumping-off point. Moveworks ensures that employees know what to do next and then do it.\\n\\nFigure 4:\\n\\nEmployees easily complete next steps over chat.\\n\\nThink about the last time you were reminded to take a survey sent out the previous week. How long are you going to spend digging through your inbox for that link? Even if you think it’s important, there is a limit to the amount of time you’ll spend on it.\\n\\nBy moving employee comms into chat, we can intelligently link employees to the training they need to complete or to the form they need to update. We made it so they can act without ever leaving the platform. Every task is a click away.\\n\\nFigure 5: Moveworks offers visibility into how employees engage with campaigns.\\n\\nFor communications teams, we offer immediate and comprehensive analytics. Before, the IT team might cross their fingers, hoping that the right people respond to their latest update. Now, the team can send periodic messages to check in with employees using a certain SaaS application.\\n\\nWhen you send messages with Moveworks, comms teams know in real-time who has taken action, allowing for additional targeted follow-up as needed. With detailed insight into user engagement, our customers craft increasingly effective campaigns, ensuring that the change they want to happen happens.\\n\\nDon't send an email. Send an expert.\\n\\nCommunication is conversation. If you want to share something important, shouting and then running away is hardly the best method. Unfortunately, this approach is common in the world of employee comms. Sending an email, for example, is static and rarely offers a two-way channel for employees to ask follow-up questions.\\n\\nWith Moveworks, every message is the beginning of a conversation with an expert.\\n\\nFigure 6:\\n\\nEmployee Comms open a direct communication line where employees can ask questions and get immediate answers.\\n\\nWith this new approach, employees aren’t just getting a message — they’re getting Moveworks and all our bot has to offer. Since our AI has read all your knowledge articles, ingested every FAQ, and knows your employee handbook to the letter, our bot can answer whatever questions they have. And unlike a static message, the bot also handles the back-and-forth on the company’s behalf, so sending an update doesn’t flood support teams with requests for clarification.\\n\\nIn seconds, our bot answers all the questions that updates to company policy or newly deployed tools raise. Sending an update or a reminder shouldn’t be a dead-end — it should open a pathway for future conversations.\\n\\nMake employee comms your differentiator.\\n\\nThere’s always been a way to communicate with employees — whether by mass email or all-hands meetings. But frequently, internal messaging is an afterthought. Using email to jumpstart change across an entire company, especially with employees working from anywhere, it’s just assumed that any big transition can take years or never happen at all.\\n\\nRobert Half challenged this assumption — using our AI-powered chatbot to get thousands of employees to adopt a new collaboration platform: Microsoft Teams. Sending targeted campaigns that showed users where to go and offering tips on how to best leverage the new platform, the company managed to get almost everyone on board in only months. Now, Robert Half’s teams have a new collaboration hub, a single digital workplace where they can do their best work without interruptions.\\n\\nBy rethinking employee comms as personalized, actionable messages that connect employees with immediate expert answers, companies can turn an afterthought into an advantage.\\n\\nFigure 7:\\n\\nLeading companies use Moveworks to update employees with relevant and actionable messages.\\n\\nContact Moveworks to learn how you can transform your employee communications.\\n\\nproduct features\\n\\nMore blog posts\\n\\nHow to unlock continual service improvement with AIOps\\n      \\n        \\n          Discover how AIOps transforms IT operations from reactive to proactive.

But as a company that builds artificial intelligence to do just that, it's our job to overcome this assumption. There's no doubt that AI systems are capable of solving remarkably complicated problems. Why should language — perhaps the most impactful problem of all — be any different?\\nSo here's the challenge: making inherently ambiguous language more like the highly structured world of chess. And to develop that structure, two techniques have proven equally critical: natural language processing (NLP) and natural language understanding (NLU). NLP organizes language into the structured data that computers require to process, while NLU interprets that data to derive meaning.\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.moveworks.com/insights/practical-guide-to-nlp-and-nlu'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"To appreciate the strides computers have already made toward understanding language, let’s talk about one of the first major challenges put before them: chess. Chess is no less complex than language, and yet computers were capable of defeating even chess grandmasters decades ago. By considering a huge amount of situational data, chess-playing programs not only figure out their next move; they also anticipate the next three moves, five moves, and even ten moves down the line.\\nIn this blog, we’ll cover:\\nHow NLP gives structure to unstructured language\\nHow NLU uses such structure to figure out a user's intent\\nWhy NLP and NLU must work in tandem to understand language\\nNLP: structuring unstructured language\\nTo learn why computers have struggled to understand language, it’s helpful to first figure out why they're so competent at playing chess.

       " Document(page_content='But while playing chess isn’t inherently easier than processing language, chess does have extremely well-defined rules. There are certain moves each piece can make and only a certain amount of space on the board for them to move. Computers thrive at finding patterns when provided with this kind of rigid structure. Yet language is not so formulaic. It breaks rules all the time.\\nFigure 1: At its most basic level, NLP involves treating each utterance as a unique string of words, with minimal interpretation. In this example — a chatbot only knows the preprogrammed phrase “I need Zoom,” and it is unable to respond to slightly altered phrasing.\\nThe easiest way to structure unstructured language is to treat each unique utterance as its own data point. The equivalent in chess would be making moves completely dependent on the opponent’s last move: advancing a pawn simply because the other person moved their rook. Obviously, this is a losing strategy — both in chess and in language learning.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.moveworks.com/insights/practical-guide-to-nlp-and-nlu'}),\n",

With a greater level of intelligence, NLP helps computers pick apart individual components of language and use them as variables to extract only relevant features from user utterances.\\nWith NLP, we reduce the infinity of language to something that has a clearly defined structure and set rules. To put it simply, we make language more like chess. Crucially, however, the job isn’t done yet.\\nNLU: playing the language game\\nAssembling the information extracted by NLP, NLU focuses primarily on comprehension: understanding utterances in the context of the broader conversation to choose the right response.\\nparaphrase detection, which determines whether a pair of utterances has the same meaning, and', metadata={'source': 'https://www.moveworks.com/insights/practical-guide-to-nlp-and-nlu'}),\n",

If NLP is about understanding the state of the game, NLU is about strategically applying that information to win the game. Thinking dozens of moves ahead is only possible after determining the ground rules and the context. Working together, these two techniques are what makes a conversational AI system a reality.

       " Document(page_content='If you’ve been following Moveworks for long, you understand the enormous potential of AI to automate support for employees — while also allowing service desks to spend more time on high-impact work.\\nBut for large and complex enterprises, achieving that level of end-to-end automation isn’t easy. Everything from company policies to user permissions to knowledge articles is in constant flux. New resources get added every day, while others become obsolete. And even the most relevant resource for a Canadian employee on the Sales team might not help an engineer in France. Without considering all of this nuance, automation projects often fail to get off the ground.\\nMoveworks is the first AI platform that’s purpose-built to automate support for the world’s largest companies. And today, we’re announcing major enhancements to our platform, designed specifically to handle these complex environments.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.moveworks.com/insights/moveworks-enhances-conversational-ai-platform'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='At the core of this announcement is Adaptive Response, a technique that enables our bot to serve up a completely custom answer based on user context and past feedback. We’re also announcing expanded integrations, a context-aware permissions system, and the ability to hand off high-touch issues to a live service desk agent. Collectively, the enhancements allow large companies to deliver instant and effortless support to their employees, with a single AI platform that keeps pace as their business evolves.\\nRead the full announcement here.\\nAdaptive Response\\nSeemingly simple issues often demand complex solutions. A lot of behind-the-scenes effort is needed to answer, “What’s the policy for taking time off?” And while a conventional chatbot would likely provide one, pre-programmed response in every situation, Moveworks takes a deeply personalized and contextual approach to support, one which adapts as companies change.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.moveworks.com/insights/moveworks-enhances-conversational-ai-platform'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='With Adaptive Response, Moveworks has taken this approach to the next level: automatically generating customized responses to each issue, based on all available resources, in real time. Building on our existing conversational AI system, Adaptive Response allows Moveworks to offer up multiple solutions when useful — for instance, a form and two knowledge articles — in a format that’s optimized to resolve support issues as quickly as possible:\\nFigure 1: Adaptive Response gives Moveworks the ability to completely customize its responses, from the resources it surfaces to even the format of the response itself.\\nWhen someone asks Moveworks about PTO, our bot considers everything from current context to user feedback, then provides the best, most up-to-date resources for that person. In Figure 1, Moveworks serves up two resources — a knowledge article and a form — that are tailor-made for the contractor who needs help.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.moveworks.com/insights/moveworks-enhances-conversational-ai-platform'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Critically, Adaptive Response also accounts for the fact that answers change. \\xa0If in two weeks this contractor is hired to work full time, his answer would be drastically different. On top of this, new resources are added, and old ones are retired all the time. At a company with thousands of knowledge articles, forms, and workflows, keeping track of so many solutions can be a frustrating and manual job. But by leveraging Adaptive Response and constantly incorporating new information, Moveworks finds the ideal path to resolution, without involving the service desk.\\nIntegrations\\nSupport teams expend a huge amount of effort to painstakingly build out their knowledge bases. The problem is that every department has its own specialized tool — the HR team might keep its knowledge in Simpplr, the IT team in Confluence, and the Finance team in SharePoint. As a result, employees struggle to track down the information they need to stay productive.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.moveworks.com/insights/moveworks-enhances-conversational-ai-platform'}),\n",

Now, when employees have questions, Moveworks can serve up a precise snippet of information from within any of these tools, or even multiple snippets if helpful. So instead of searching through endless systems or filing a support ticket, employees can simply describe any issue to Moveworks — directly in Microsoft Teams or Slack — and get an answer in seconds, all without any manual configuration.\\nPermissions\\nOne of the biggest challenges in automating support is that different users have different permissions. Making sure that only authorized users can see restricted content isn’t something that simple, pre-programmed chatbots do well. In fact, even for the service desk, it can be incredibly difficult to ensure that information always ends up in the right hands.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.moveworks.com/insights/moveworks-enhances-conversational-ai-platform'}),\n",

Our platform can now restrict access based on location, seniority, department, and other important factors, understanding complex layers of user information to provide individualized support automatically. And because Moveworks can ingest existing access control roles from service desk systems, like ServiceNow, incorporating permissions into the platform is straightforward for support teams.\\nLive Agent Handoff\\nMoveworks automates a high percentage of issues all by itself, but some situations will always require a person to step in and help out.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.moveworks.com/insights/moveworks-enhances-conversational-ai-platform'}),\n",

Can I get an interactive demo using my own data?\\nWhen vendors provide demos, they often use their own data to showcase their system's capabilities, which may not accurately reflect how the platform will perform with your unique data.\\nWhile the vendor's demo may appear impressive, it's essential to test the system with your data to determine if it's the right fit for your needs. And by using your own data, you can make sure that any analysis they provide uses their production models and processes, rather than any behind-the-scenes wizardry.\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.moveworks.com/insights/how-to-evaluate-conversational-ai-platforms'}),\n",

How are you using large language models?\\nMany conversational AI vendors will say, “We use GPT-3!” without being able to dive deeper into why large language models (LLMs) are a critical part of any conversational AI product.\\nEnterprise conversational AI requires the ability to understand the specific language used in that workplace. It may be challenging for vendors to develop on their own due to a lack of sufficient data. And it may be equally challenging for vendors who are just an interface on top of an LLM to answer business-related queries.

Given how fast this space is moving, it's important to know how many LLMs have been retired and how often new ones are added to their stack. A vendor simply saying they use LLMs is not enough, as the best and most efficient models are constantly evolving.\\n3.\\xa0What tangible value are you bringing to customers?\\nIt's important to understand the tangible value a vendor is bringing to customers before investing in a product. Don't just take their word for it — ask for reference calls with current customers to get a better understanding of their experience with the product, how it’s performing, and how long it took to get them to that point. Or even better, ask them for a brief demo.

It’s not something that’s going to happen overnight.\\nIf a company has no prior experience using LLMs, it may take years to build the necessary infrastructure. However, companies with a history of using LLMs are in a better position to quickly adopt the capabilities of this technology in their products.

       " Document(page_content='When people think about AI, they often turn to the most extreme use cases. But at Forrester’s Technology & Innovation Forum, I was reminded yet again of the importance of focusing on what’s practical.\\nAI is no longer just a series of conceptual, pie-in-the-sky prototypes, ideas, and far-fetched science experiments. It’s now a core driver for companies who want to become a “future fit” organization — one that’s adaptive, creative, and resilient. In fact, millions of business leaders use AI every day to drive efficiency across their organizations, with individual use cases yielding millions in top- and bottom-line impact.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.moveworks.com/insights/forrester-technology-and-innovation-forum-practical-ai'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='After two days of rubbing elbows with leading industry analysts, the verdict is clear: AI is no longer a nice-to-have — it’s a necessity for your business success. It’s here to stay, and how it’s implemented will separate leaders from laggards. Further, a repeatable framework is needed to help inform AI investment decisions and measure their results. With these three things in mind, you can make AI practical. Let’s dive a bit deeper:\\n1. AI is table stakes\\nUnsurprisingly, AI was a hot topic at this event. Numerous sessions led by organizations such as Qualcomm and CognitiveScale touched on the value of AI, and how they’ve leveraged its capabilities to scale their operations and enable flexible work.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.moveworks.com/insights/forrester-technology-and-innovation-forum-practical-ai'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='What’s notable is that many organizations today are using AI not just in innovation labs adjacent to their core business, but in their daily operations. Looking forward, Forrester estimates that nearly 100% of all enterprises will use AI by 2025. That’s right, less than three years from now, using AI will be business as usual for millions of employees across the world. That’s an incredibly eye-opening projection — AI isn’t a nice-to-have any more, it’s instrumental to business competition.\\n2. A successful AI deployment starts with choosing the right use cases\\nOf course I’m biased, but I found Pinterest’s Derrick Diaz’s presentation about his experience deploying Moveworks’ conversational AI platform particularly enlightening. Acknowledging that AI is a growing space, he talked about why he partnered with Moveworks to drive his digital transformation initiatives.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.moveworks.com/insights/forrester-technology-and-innovation-forum-practical-ai'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"For Derrick, it was of the utmost importance to find the right applications for AI. And I’m sure many business leaders can relate to this pressure since 85% of AI and machine learning projects fail to deliver, and only 53% of projects make it from prototype to production. With as many AI use cases as there are business processes, choosing the wrong approach and application will tie up valuable resources, waste time, and ultimately lose money for your organization.\\nThat’s why Derrick was hyper-focused on the limits of what AI can and should do on its own. While AI is great for automation and handling repetitive work, there are plenty of situations where a human touch is still needed. The key is knowing the difference. My learning? Invest in AI that unlocks time for employees so they can focus on the most valuable, meaningful, and creative work. AI can — and at Pinterest, does — take care of the rest.\\nFigure 1: The Moveworks team at Forrester's Technology & Innovation Forum\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.moveworks.com/insights/forrester-technology-and-innovation-forum-practical-ai'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Figure 1: The Moveworks team at Forrester's Technology & Innovation Forum\\n3. AI’s value starts and ends with its impact\\nThere’s a general lack of understanding and consistency in evaluating both an AI tool's potential value before deployment and measuring its realized value after deployment. This makes it challenging when you want to calculate returns on investments on the front end (hoping and praying they deliver value), and when you want to measure results (over- or under-valuing impact) on the back end.\\nTo overcome these obstacles, you need a repeatable framework that reliably estimates value opportunity and measures value realized. I’ll write about this more in upcoming blog posts, but at a high level, this framework starts with business and IT stakeholder alignment on the outcomes you seek to achieve and an understanding of how to measure strategic and operational KPIs over time.\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.moveworks.com/insights/forrester-technology-and-innovation-forum-practical-ai'}),\n",

It’s important to understand which business investments are delivering positive results, especially in the economic climate we’re experiencing today. At Moveworks, we partner with our customers to align on their desired business outcomes and on KPIs that will help to inform their investment decisions and assess performance in the long run.\\nWith 65% of firms increasing their emerging tech spend in the upcoming year, many business leaders are keen to take advantage of the opportunities created through technologies like AI. Whether they plan to use it to enhance the ROI of existing technology investments or drive greater employee productivity, having a clear understanding of the business outcomes AI will drive is paramount.

For example, an employee might be locked out of their account from 3:00 p.m. Friday until 9:00 a.m. the following Monday. MTTR would say the issue was resolved in two hours.

Today, we’re excited to announce the next stage: Moveworks for HR, a sophisticated artificial intelligence solution built for people teams.\\nHR’s always been complex, but we have witnessed a sea change on an industry level over the last 20-plus months. HR teams have been put on the spot, responsible for creating the best places to work during a time of extreme unpredictability. They’ve had to develop health and safety protocols; address employee burnout and well-being; manage flexible and hybrid work logistics; and recruit, hire, and onboard. The list goes on.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.moveworks.com/insights/announcing-moveworks-for-hr'}),\n",

As of today, the Moveworks platform helps focus HR teams on meaningful work, and employees get what they need by:\\nAnswering common HR questions instantly\\nAccelerating support for even the most complex and delicate HR issues\\nIncreasing the ROI for existing HR systems\\nAnswer common HR questions instantly\\nEmployees have tons of questions.

There’s no way the HR teams accounted for every possible keyword or phrase an employee might use.\\nFigure 1:\\xa0HR support requires deep understanding and personalization. With AI, we ensure that every employee gets a custom-built response.\\nAn additional complication is that the majority of HR knowledge is localized. If a Canadian and a Spanish employee ask the same question, they’re likely to need two different answers. This presents a unique challenge for automation.

Manage a life event, request an employment verification letter, find tax forms, approve expenses, and update healthcare benefits — our platform can help with all these use cases and more.\\nFigure 3: Moveworks for HR unifies existing HR systems to provide the best up-to-date answer or action.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.moveworks.com/insights/announcing-moveworks-for-hr'}),\n",

Even with the latest automation tools, ensuring high-quality support across borders is a massive challenge, requiring dedicated experts to anticipate every employee issue, set up workflows in various languages, and constantly maintain every dialog as the business environment evolves.\\nThat said, every employee deserves to get the same support. It shouldn’t matter if they’re based in the New York headquarters, a satellite office in Mexico City, or a home office in Paris.

It doesn’t trap you in a never-ending dialog flow.\\nThis seamless experience is only possible with Moveworks. Unlike conventional chatbots that rely on someone manually designating every employee’s language preference or forcing employees to learn yet another new system — we threw out the script.\\nFigure 2: Keeping track of an employee’s location, department, and language preferences, a chatbot can surface information that's the most helpful to a specific employee.\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.moveworks.com/insights/how-moveworks-built-multilingual-ai-platform'}),\n",

She’s not trapped in a dialog flow; she’s having a real conversation with actionable steps forward.\\nTo make interacting with a chatbot as easy in English as in any other language, our first decision was to play to build on what makes our platform so great to begin with.

We’ve also evolved our probabilistic bidding system, Action Bid™, to consider and reconsider every possible path forward, surfacing next steps in the language — or languages — with the highest likelihood to solve the issue.\\nOur bot adapts to language preferences in real-time to ensure natural back-and-forth communication, even when requests involve multiple languages or multiple users.

We treat every employee request as complex words and phrases with context and intent, not just as clusters of keywords. Within Language Core, natural language processing (NLP) organizes any language into structured data — disambiguating entities, analyzing grammar, adding accents, and correcting typos — to understand the nuances to each language we support.\\nBut perhaps more importantly, our natural language understanding (NLU) focuses on domain and entity detection across languages to figure out what people at work need, no matter what language they use.

In this case, our model automatically tags any words meant to remain in English, like “worldwide sales” here. By preserving this phrase, our system can search for that group name and correctly retrieve the top options. If “sales” were automatically translated to Spanish, this request would have failed, and Marina would have to start all over again.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.moveworks.com/insights/how-moveworks-built-multilingual-ai-platform'}),\n",

The platform will offer Jamf employees 24/7 autonomous support for all IT-related issues — regardless of their location, role, and language preference. Moveworks will enable Jamf to scale a world-class hybrid work support model that’s efficient, cost-effective, and personalized to each employee.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.moveworks.com/press-releases/2022/11/moveworks-ai-platform-powers-jamfs-new-standard-for-hybrid-work-support'}),\n",

But despite providing incredible flexibility for employees, hybrid models have created deep complexity for IT teams, and frustrating roadblocks for employees as a result. That’s why Jamf chose to roll out Moveworks: To ensure its employees get the highest quality support possible — no matter where they’re working from — in an efficient and cost effective way. In doing so, Jamf is demonstrating what best-in-class employee support looks like in today’s modern, hybrid workforce.\\n“Our customers count on us to help deliver a seamless technology experience to their employees,” said Linh Lam, CIO at Jamf. “In order to do that, we have to constantly refine our own approach to technology and the way we support our employees.

Deeply embedded in almost every aspect of the employee experience, from performance reviews to benefits to PTO requests, HR teams are flooded with questions and requests for help. That’s why — more than ever — HR needs a new approach to support.\\nOther employee support departments have addressed their expanding roles by enabling employees to self-service routine support issues. Take IT. For years, tech support has consumed a significant proportion of IT's time and resources, leading many to implement rigorous tracking systems and create libraries of content to help employees help themselves.\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.moveworks.com/insights/unlocking-tier-0-automate-hr-service-delivery'}),\n",

So to get to a point where employees can answer their own HR questions — known as Tier 0 support — HR teams need to connect the dots between employees and content.\\nHere at Moveworks, we asked ourselves: What insights can we gather on service delivery to help HR teams move closer to Tier 0? With this goal in mind, we analyzed thousands of real-world HR requests from several global companies to generate three key insights:\\nHR teams produce a huge amount of knowledge to enable Tier 0 support.\\nHowever, HR knowledge is highly personalized and location-specific, which makes self-service difficult for employees.\\nNew machine learning techniques can overcome the complexity of HR issues.\\nThe right answer already exists', metadata={'source': 'https://www.moveworks.com/insights/unlocking-tier-0-automate-hr-service-delivery'}),\n",

HR creates more content than all the other employee support departments combined.\\nThe problem is that employees aren’t using that knowledge.\\nTake a 100-page employee handbook. Most employees won't even scroll through it. And even if they read it, whenever HR updates the handbook, that information becomes stale and out-of-date. So what do employees do instead? They do what’s easy: email HR directly, flooding the team’s inboxes with dozens of support requests.\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.moveworks.com/insights/unlocking-tier-0-automate-hr-service-delivery'}),\n",

In some ways, automatically solving an IT issue is easier than doing the same for HR. A computer is a computer. The computer doesn’t change if an employee moves to a different country or switches to a different department.\\nHR issues are fundamentally personal and inextricably linked to each employee’s unique location, department, and role.

       " Document(page_content='To bring this point home, at least half of HR knowledge — sometimes as much as 70% — is tied to location, while basically less than one percent of IT knowledge is geo-specific.\\nClearly, with all of this knowledge floating around, finding the answer to a seemingly simple question can become frustrating and time-consuming for everyone involved.\\nThink about a typical HR question: What are my benefits? Employees rarely include every little bit of context needed for HR to give them the right answer. Point of fact, in our analysis, only 15% of employees specified their location when asking HR a question. So, HR professionals must manually dig through various siloed backend systems to address each new issue.\\nThis need for personalization makes Tier 0 support difficult but not impossible. With layers of AI and machine learning, our solution can look at an employee within the context of their location or role.\\nFigure 2: Since most HR knowledge is localized, automating HR can be a challenge.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.moveworks.com/insights/unlocking-tier-0-automate-hr-service-delivery'}),\n",

Either it’s hidden away in some siloed, backend system, or it’s so specific to employees' locations or roles that finding the right answer is practically impossible without help.\\nGiven this complexity, Tier 0 support is only possible with machine learning. Recent advances in the machine learning field of natural language understanding allow automated systems to break down HR questions, analyzing each one in the context of past conversations and who the employee is.

With machine learning, however, that information is surfaced in seconds. Employees get what they need, and the HR team isn’t wasting time writing content that no one ever sees.\\nWhat we’ve learned in our analysis of HR requests is that enabling self-service is a nontrivial challenge. But we also see a massive opportunity for machine learning to transform how HR teams deliver support. Large companies deal with thousands of HR requests each month, and the majority of these requests can be answered with the knowledge that HR has already created.

But, new leaders also have a lot on their plate. How do you prioritize which initiatives to tackle first?\\nYousuf: First off — having a vision for the future is hugely important for any new CIO.

There’s no one-size-fits-all approach to benchmarking. Measuring success involves a lot of intuition and practice. It’s tough because the shape and strategy and philosophy of every company are different. And as a result of that, IT operations are kind of all over the map, which is why I say that quantifying success is more about intuition and your experience as an IT leader. Of course, there are some quantitative measures to take into account, but these represent operational improvements, not the results of a strategic change in the short term.\\nAnd that's why being part of a CIO community is very important.

If a certain process is taking long, is frustrating, or is wasting resources, it shows up. It shows up in meetings. It shows up when you want to get things done.\\nThat’s when it’s time for you to start asking questions: What process is causing the pain? How can we iterate? Can we automate?

We like to solve problems with technology and automation. We’re always looking for the next opportunity. Mainly, it takes a lot of pure observation and analysis.\\nTo back up a bit, one of the key anchors for a CIO role is to drive employee productivity. And a big part of increasing productivity is building a great experience and ensuring that every employee can easily get what they need to get their job done.\\nWhen I’m looking to deploy automation or AI, for me, it's a very binary decision.

Particularly with the majority of US employees now reliant on technology to get anything done during work-from-home, solving tech issues faster has become business-critical. When an application isn’t working or you can’t log into an account, you can no longer tap the shoulder of the IT professional sitting next to you.

       " Document(page_content='Regular readers of this blog know that AI can resolve many tech issues instantly, with no involvement from the help desk. About half of these issues are relatively routine — unlocking accounts, provisioning software, creating email lists — yet still take an average of three days to address using the traditional approach. Our primary focus is eliminating that delay from end to end: Employees describe their problems to our chatbot, and Moveworks solves them seconds later.\\nBut what about complicated, high-touch requests, which require experts to resolve? These are the issues that often drag on for weeks, that take multiple interactions between employee and IT team, and that sometimes get lost in the shuffle for good. After analyzing millions of such complex requests, we identified three fundamental challenges:\\nEvery back-and-forth between the employee and IT team adds a 1.75-day delay.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.moveworks.com/insights/ai-powered-concierge-for-it-support'}),\n",

At a time when other types of communication occur in seconds, exchanges with IT still span days. The primary culprit is the way IT teams engage with employees: email and siloed support portals. These channels live outside employees’ regular workflows and aren’t inherently interactive, so when high-touch issues require several conversations to complete, the whole process comes to a grinding halt:\\nWhile most IT issues require less than two comments to resolve, high-touch issues that need more comments significantly increase the mean time to resolution, or MTTR.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.moveworks.com/insights/ai-powered-concierge-for-it-support'}),\n",

The result? Help desk agents read through thousands of ticket comments each month — an endless queue that makes communication delays inevitable.\\nReducing that delay from days down to just seconds is a task tailor-made for an AI system, provided it could:\\nUnderstand the language employees naturally use when talking to the IT team\\nIntelligently manage thousands of IT interactions, so nothing gets lost in the shuffle\\nHandle everything on the enterprise messaging tool, rather than via email or portal', metadata={'source': 'https://www.moveworks.com/insights/ai-powered-concierge-for-it-support'}),\n",

Unlike emails, which can sit unread for days or even weeks, Concierge is designed to take advantage of the nature of Slack and Teams to conduct thousands of IT conversations in real time.
